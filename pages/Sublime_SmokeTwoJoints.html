<h3>Smoke Two Joints</h3>
<h4>Sublime</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  ``She was living in a single room with three other<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp individuals 
<br/>
 One of them was a male and the other two...well 
<br/>
 the other two were females! 
<br/>
 God only knows what they were up to in there. 
<br/>
 And furthermore Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp surprised to learn that 
<br/>
 all four of them habitually smoked marijuana cigarettes!
<br/>
 REEFERS!\" 
<br/>

I sm<span class="chord">Am</span>oke two joints in the morning 
<br/>
<br/>
I sm<span class="chord">F</span>oke two joints at night 
<br/>
<br/>
I sm<span class="chord">Am</span>oke two joints in the afternoon 
<br/>
<br/>
It m<span class="chord">F</span>akes me feel all right 
<br/>
 
<br/>
I smoke two joints in time of peace 
<br/>
And two in time of war 
<br/>
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints, 
<br/>
And then I smoke two more 
<br/>
 
<br/>
