<h3>Smoke Two Joints</h3>
<h4>Sublime</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  ``She was living in a single room with three other individuals 
<br/>
 One of them was a male and the other two...well 
<br/>
 the other two were females! 
<br/>
 God only knows what they were up to in there. 
<br/>
 And furthermore Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that 
<br/>
 all four of them habitually smoked marijuana cigarettes!
<br/>
 REEFERS!\" 
<br/>

<br/>
 
<br/>
I sm<span>Am</span>oke two joints in the morning 
<br/>
I sm<span>F</span>oke two joints at night 
<br/>
I sm<span>Am</span>oke two joints in the afternoon 
<br/>
It m<span>F</span>akes me feel all right 
<br/>
 
<br/>
I smoke two joints in time of peace 
<br/>
And two in time of war 
<br/>
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints, 
<br/>
And then I smoke two more 
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
 
<br/>
``Smoked cigarettes till the day she died
<br/>
Toke a big spliff of some good sensimillia\"
<br/>
 
<br/>
Daddy he once told me, 
<br/>
'Son, you be hard workin' man' 
<br/>
And momma she once told me, 
<br/>
'Son, you do the best you can' 
<br/>
But th<span>G</span>en one day I met a man, 
<br/>
He c<span>F</span>ame to me and said, 
<br/>
'Hard w<span>G</span>ork good and hard w<span>F</span>ork fine, 
<br/>
but f<span>E</span>irst take care of head'
<br/>
 
<br/>
Whoa rock me to the night 
<br/>
Ja say Whoa
