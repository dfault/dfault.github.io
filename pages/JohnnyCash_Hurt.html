<br/>
I <span>C</span>hurt my<span>D</span>self <span>Am</span>today
<br/>
To <span>C</span>see if <span>D</span>I still <span>Am</span>feel
<br/>
I <span>C</span>focus <span>D</span>on the <span>Am</span>pain
<br/>
The <span>C</span>only <span>D</span>thing that's <span>Am</span>real
<br/>
The <span>C</span>needle <span>D</span>tears a <span>Am</span>hole
<br/>
The <span>C</span>old fa<span>D</span>miliar <span>Am</span>sting
<br/>
Try to <span>C</span>kill it <span>D</span>all <span>Am</span>away
<br/>
But I <span>C</span>remember <span>D</span>every<span>G</span>thing
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>What have I be<span>F</span>come
<br/>
<span>C</span>My sweetest <span>G</span>friend
<br/>
<span>Am</span>Everyone I <span>F</span>know goes <span>C</span>away
<br/>
In the <span>G</span>end
<br/>
And <span>Am</span>you could have it <span>F</span>all
<br/>
<span>G</span>My empire of dirt
<br/>
<span>Am</span>I will let you <span>F</span>down
<br/>
<span>G</span>I will make you <span>Am</span>hurt
<br/>

<br/>
I wear this crown of thorns
<br/>
Upon my liar's chair
<br/>
Full of broken thoughts
<br/>
I cannot repair
<br/>
Beneath the stains of time
<br/>
The feelings disappear
<br/>
You are someone else
<br/>
I am still right here
<br/>

<br/>
What have I become
<br/>
My sweetest friend
<br/>
Everyone I know goes away
<br/>
In the end
<br/>
And you could have it all
<br/>
My empire of dirt
<br/>
I will let you down
<br/>
I will make you hurt
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>If I could start <span>F</span>again
<br/>
A <span>G</span>million miles away
<br/>
<span>Am</span>I would keep my<span>F</span>self
<br/>
<span>G</span>I would find a <span>Am</span>way
