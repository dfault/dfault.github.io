<h3>The Man Comes Around</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>
<br/>
There's a <span class="chord">C</span>man going around taking names and he decides
<br/>
Who to free and who to blame every body won't be treated
<br/>
Quite the same there will be a golden ladder reaching<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">Am</span>down
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>When the <span class="chord">G</span>man comes <span class="chord">C</span>around
<br/>

<br/>
The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each
<br/>
Sip and each sup will you partake of that last offered cup
<br/>
Or disappear into the potter's ground
<br/>
When the man comes around
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Hear the trumpets hear the pipers one hundred million<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp angels singing
<br/>
<br/>
Multitudes are marching to a <span class="chord">F</span>big kettle<span class="chord">G</span>drum
<br/>
Voices calling and voices crying
<br/>
Some are born and some are dying
<br/>
<br/>
Its alpha and omegas kingdom <span class="chord">C</span>come
<br/>
<br/>
And the <span class="chord">F</span>whirlwind is in the <span class="chord">C</span>thorn trees
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">C</span>virgins are all trimming their wicks
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">F</span>whirlwind is in the <span class="chord">C</span>thorn trees
<br/>
<br/>
It's <span class="chord">C</span>hard for thee to kick against the pricks
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Till Armageddon no shalom no shalom
<br/>
Then the father hen will call his chicken's home
<br/>
The wise man will bow down before the thorn and at his feet
<br/>
<br/>
They will cast the golden <span class="chord">Am</span>crowns
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>When the <span class="chord">G</span>man comes <span class="chord">C</span>around
<br/>

<br/>
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
<br/>
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
<br/>
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
<br/>
Listen to the words long written down
<br/>
When the man comes around
<br/>
