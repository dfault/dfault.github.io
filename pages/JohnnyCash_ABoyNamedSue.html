<br/>
My <span class="chord">C</span>daddy left home when I was three
<br/>
<br/>
And he <span class="chord">F</span>didn't leave much to ma and me
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">G</span>Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of <span class="chord">C</span>booze.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, <span class="chord">C</span>I don't blame him cause he run and hid
<br/>
<br/>
But the <span class="chord">F</span>meanest thing that he ever did
<br/>
<br/>
Was <span class="chord">G</span>before he left, he went and named me <span class="chord">C</span>Sue
<br/>

<br/>
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
<br/>
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
<br/>
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
<br/>
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
<br/>
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
<br/>
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
<br/>
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
<br/>
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
<br/>
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
<br/>
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
<br/>
And kill that man who gave me that awful name.
<br/>

<br/>
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
<br/>
And I just hit town and my throat was dry,
<br/>
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.
<br/>
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
<br/>
There at a table, dealing stud,
<br/>
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue.
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
<br/>
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had,
<br/>
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
<br/>
He was big and bent and gray and old,
<br/>
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
<br/>
And I said: My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
<br/>
Now your gonna die!!
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
<br/>
And he went down, but to my surprise,
<br/>
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
<br/>
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
<br/>
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
<br/>
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp beer.
<br/>

<br/>
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
<br/>
But I really can't remember when,
<br/>
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
<br/>
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
<br/>
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,
<br/>
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.
<br/>

<br/>
And he said: Son, this world is rough
<br/>
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
<br/>
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along.
<br/>
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
<br/>
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
<br/>
And it's the name that helped to make you strong.
<br/>

<br/>
He said: Now you just fought one hell of a fight
<br/>
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
<br/>
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
<br/>
But ya ought to thank me, before I die,
<br/>
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
<br/>
Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue.
<br/>

<br/>
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
<br/>
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,
<br/>
And I came away with a different point of view.
<br/>
And I think about him, now and then,
<br/>
Every time I try and every time I win,
<br/>
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
<br/>
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!
