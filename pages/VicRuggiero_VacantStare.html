<h3>Vacant Stare</h3>
<h4>Vic Ruggiero</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">E</span>I Waited long when there was <span class="chord">c#</span>no one there for me
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">E</span>I held your hand down there when <span class="chord">c#</span>no one else could<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp see,
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>kissed you <span class="chord">B</span>lips and with them i <span class="chord">E</span>swore i'd always be<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp there 
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>for your <span class="chord">a</span>vacant stare
<br/>

<br/>
When i said these words, i thought you may have wept,
<br/>
that dreamin was the only reason that i slept
<br/>
and boredom was the only company i kept, except
<br/>
for your vacant stare
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">B</span>thanks but i'm aware of all the <span class="chord">E</span>things im not
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">B</span>thanks for the television <span class="chord">E</span>memories i got
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">B</span>suffice to say our chemistr<span class="chord">E</span>y was simply hot <span class="chord">F#</span>air
<br/>
<br/>
and your vacant <span class="chord">B</span>stare
<br/>

<br/>
so excepting evil is just as it does
<br/>
I promised i'd be all i could be just because
<br/>
but thought i looked this hard i found the cubbert was bare
<br/>

<br/>
but for your vacant stare
<br/>
but for your vacant stare
<br/>
but for your vacant stare 
<br/>
