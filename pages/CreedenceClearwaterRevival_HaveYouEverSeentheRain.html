<h3>Have You Ever Seen the Rain</h3>
<h4>Creedence Clearwater Revival</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  S<span>C</span>omeone told me long ago
<br/>
T<span>C</span>here's a calm before the storm, I k<span>G</span>now
<br/>
And it's been coming f<span>C</span>or some time
<br/>

<br/>
When it's over, so they say
<br/>
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
<br/>
Shining down like water
<br/>

<br/>
<span>F</span>I wa<span>G</span>nna know
<br/>
Have you e<span>C</span>ver s<span>C/B</span>een the r<span>Am</span>ain&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>C/G</span>
<br/>
<span>F</span>I wa<span>G</span>nna know
<br/>
Have you e<span>C</span>ver s<span>C/B</span>een the r<span>Am</span>ain&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>C/G</span>
<br/>
C<span>F</span>oming d<span>G</span>own on a sunny d<span>C</span>ay
<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday and days before
<br/>
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
<br/>
Been that way for all my time
<br/>

<br/>
'Til forever on it goes
<br/>
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
<br/>
And it can't stop, I wonder
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
Coming down on a sunny day
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
Coming down on a sunny day
