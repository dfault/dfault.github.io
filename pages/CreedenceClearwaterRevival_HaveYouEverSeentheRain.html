When it's over, so they say

<br/>
Yesterday and days before
<br/>
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
<br/>
Been that way for all my time
<br/>

<br/>
'Til forever on it goes
<br/>
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
<br/>
And it can't stop, I wonder
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
Coming down on a sunny day
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
I wanna know
<br/>
Have you ever seen the rain
<br/>
Coming down on a sunny day
