<h3>On the cover of the Rolling Stone</h3>
<h4>Dr.\ Hook</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>

<br/>
Well we are <span>A</span>big rock singers, we've got golden fingers
<br/>
And we're loved everywhere we <span>E</span>go
<br/>
We sing about beauty and we sing about truth
<br/>
At ten thousand dollars a <span>A</span>show
<br/>
We take all kind of pills to give us all kind of thrills
<br/>
But the thrill we've never <span>E</span>known
<br/>
Is the thrill that'll get you when you get your picture
<br/>
On the cover of the Rolling <span>A</span>Stone
<br/>

<br/>
<span>A</span>Rolling <span>E</span>Stone\ldots  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {\sl Wanna see my picture on the cover}
<br/>
<span>E</span>Rolling <span>A</span>Stone\ldots  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {\sl Wanna buy five copies for my mother}
<br/>
<span>A</span>Rolling <span>E</span>Stone\ldots  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  {\sl Wanna see my smilin' face}
<br/>
On the <span>D</span>cover of the Rolling Stone
<br/>

<br/>
I've got a freaky old lady name o' Cocaine Katy
<br/>
Who embroiders on my jeans
<br/>
I've got my poor old gray-haired Daddy
<br/>
Drivin' my limousine
<br/>
Now it's all designed to blow our minds
<br/>
But our minds won't really be blown
<br/>
Like the blow that'll get you when you get your picture
<br/>
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
<br/>

<br/>
-- Refrain --
<br/>

<br/>
We got a lot of little teenage blue-eyed groupies
<br/>
Who do anything we say
<br/>
We got a genuine Indian guru
<br/>
He's teachin' us a better way
<br/>
We got all the friends that money can buy
<br/>
So we never have to be alone
<br/>
And we keep gettin' richer but we can't get our picture
<br/>
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
<br/>

<br/>
-- Refrain --
<br/>
