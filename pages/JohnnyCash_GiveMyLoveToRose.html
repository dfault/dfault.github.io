<h3>Give My Love To Rose</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>

<br/>
I <span>A</span>found him by the <span>E</span>railroad track this <span>A</span>morning
<br/>
<span>A</span>I could see that <span>E</span>he was nearly <span>A</span>dead
<br/>
<span>D</span>I knelt down beside him and I <span>A</span>listened
<br/>
Just to <span>E</span>hear the words the dying fellow said
<br/>

<br/>
He said they <span>A</span>let me out of <span>E</span>prison down in <span>A</span>Frisco
<br/>
For <span>A</span>ten long years I've <span>E</span>paid for what I've <span>A</span>done
<br/>
I was <span>D</span>trying to get back to <span>A</span>Louisiana
<br/>
To <span>E</span>see my Rose and get to know my <span>A</span>son
<br/>

<br/>
<span>D</span>Give my love to Rose please won't you <span>A</span>mister
<br/>
<span>E</span>Take her all my money, tell her to <span>A</span>buy some pretty clothes
<br/>
<span>D</span>Tell my boy his daddy's so proud <span>A</span>of him
<br/>
And <span>E</span>don't forget to give my love to <span>A</span>Rose
<br/>

<br/>
Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
<br/>
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
<br/>
Tell my Rose to try to find another
<br/>
For it ain't right that she should live alone
<br/>

<br/>
Mister here's a bag with all my money
<br/>
It won't last them long the way it goes
<br/>
God bless you for finding me this morning
<br/>
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
<br/>

<br/>
Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
<br/>
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
<br/>
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him
<br/>
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
