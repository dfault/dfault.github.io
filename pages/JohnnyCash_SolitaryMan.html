<br/>
<span>Em</span>Belinda was <span>Am</span>mine 'til the <span>G</span>time that I <span>Em</span>found her
<br/>
<span>G</span>Holdin' <span>Am</span>Jim
<br/>
<span>G</span>And lovin' <span>Am</span>him
<br/>
<span>Em</span>Then Sue came <span>Am</span>along, loved me <span>G</span>strong, that's what <span>Em</span>I thought
<br/>
<span>G</span>But me and <span>Am</span>Sue,
<br/>
<span>G</span>That died, <span>Am</span>too.
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>Don't know that I <span>C</span>will but <span>G</span>until I can <span>D</span>find me
<br/>
A girl who'll <span>C</span>stay and won't <span>G</span>play games beh<span>D</span>ind me
<br/>
I'll be what I <span>Em</span>am
<br/>
<span>D</span>A solitary <span>Em</span>man
<br/>
<span>D</span>A solitary <span>Em</span>man
<br/>

<br/>
I've had it here - being where love's a small word
<br/>
A part time thing
<br/>
A paper ring
<br/>
I know it's been done havin' one girl who loves you
<br/>
Right or wrong
<br/>
Weak or strong
