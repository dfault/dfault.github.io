<br/>
<span>G</span>I'll make a shoehorn outta your shin
<br/>
<span>G</span>I'll make a lampshade of durable skin
<br/>
And <span>E7</span>oh, don't you know that I'm always feelin' able
<br/>
<span>E7</span>When I'm sittin' home and I'm carving out your navel
<br/>
<span>G</span>im just a sittin' here carving out your navel
<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>When will I <span>B</span>realize that this <span>C</span>skin I'm in
<br/>
Hey, it <span>B</span>isn't mine
<br/>
<span>C</span>And when will the <span>B</span>kill be too much <span>C</span>meat for me to <span>B</span>hide <span>E7</span>on
<br/>

<br/>
Hey, I could really use a couple of hands
<br/>
To complete one hell of a plant stand
<br/>
Oh, and don't you know that I'm caught here in the middle
<br/>
Making rib cages into coffee tables
<br/>
I'm just makin' em into coffee tables
<br/>

<br/>
And when will I realize that this skin I'm in
<br/>
Hey, it isn't mine
<br/>
And when will the thrill be too much meat for me to find anymore
<br/>

<br/>
Oh, because you <span>C</span>know I can't hide
<br/>
But oh how <span>G</span>hard I try
<br/>
But <span>D</span>this is just the shape I'm <span>G</span>in, oh yeah
<br/>
al<span>Em</span>though I know I can't hide
<br/>
But oh <span>A</span>how hard I try
<br/>
But <span>C</span>this is just the <span>D</span>shape I'm <span>G</span>in
<br/>
oh yeah, oh yeah
<br/>
