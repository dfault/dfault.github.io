<h3>Tennessee Stud</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>Back about eighteen and twenty-five
<br/>
<br/>
I <span class="chord">G</span>left Tennessee very much alive
<br/>
<br/>
I nev<span class="chord">A</span>er would've made it through the Arkansas mud
<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn't been riding on the <span class="chord">E</span>Tennessee <span class="chord">A</span>Stud
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
H<span class="chord">A</span>ad some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">G</span>One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fudd
<br/>
<br/>
And I rode away on the <span class="chord">E</span>Tennessee <span class="chord">A</span>Stud
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">A</span>Tennessee Stud was <span class="chord">G</span>long and <span class="chord">A</span>lean
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">D</span>color of the sun and his <span class="chord">C</span>eyes were <span class="chord">E</span>green
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>He had the nerve and he had the blood
<br/>
<br/>
There never was a horse like <span class="chord">E</span>Tennessee <span class="chord">A</span>Stud
<br/>

<br/>
Drifted on down into no man's land
<br/>
Across the river called the Rio Grande
<br/>
Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
<br/>
Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
<br/>

<br/>
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
<br/>
We got in a fight over Tennessee
<br/>
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
<br/>
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">A</span>Tennessee Stud was <span class="chord">G</span>long and <span class="chord">A</span>lean
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">D</span>color of the sun and his <span class="chord">C</span>eyes were <span class="chord">E</span>green
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>He had the nerve and he had the blood
<br/>
<br/>
There never was a horse like <span class="chord">E</span>Tennessee <span class="chord">A</span>Stud
<br/>

<br/>
I rode right back across Arkansas
<br/>
I whupped her brother and I whupped her Pa
<br/>
I found that girl with the golden hair
<br/>
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare
<br/>

<br/>
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
<br/>
Little horse colt playing round the door
<br/>
I loved the girl with the golden hair
<br/>
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">A</span>Tennessee Stud was <span class="chord">G</span>long and <span class="chord">A</span>lean
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">D</span>color of the sun and his <span class="chord">C</span>eyes were <span class="chord">E</span>green
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>He had the nerve and he had the blood
<br/>
<br/>
There never was a horse like <span class="chord">E</span>Tennessee <span class="chord">A</span>Stud
