<h3>Let's make the water turn black</h3>
<h4>Frank Zappa</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>C</span>Now believe me when <span>Em</span>I tell you that my <span>Am</span>song is really true
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>I want <span>Em</span>everyone to <span>Fm</span>listen and <span>G</span>believe
<br/>
<span>C</span>It's about some <span>Em</span>little people from a <span>Am</span>long time ago
<br/>
<span>Bb</span>And all the <span>Eb</span>things the <span>Ab</span>neighbors didn't <span>G</span>know
<br/>
<span>C</span>Early in the <span>Em</span>morning Daddy <span>Am</span>Dinky went to work
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>Selling lamps and <span>Em</span>chairs to <span>Fm</span>San Ber'dino <span>G</span>Squares
<br/>
<span>C</span>And I still <span>Em</span>remember mama with her <span>Am</span>apron and her pad
<br/>
<span>Bb</span>Feeding all the <span>Am</span>boys in Ed's <span>D</span>Cafe
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>Whizzing and <span>F</span>pasting and <span>G</span>pooting through the <span>Am</span>day
<br/>
<span>G</span>Ronnie helping <span>Am</span>Kenny helping <span>Bm</span>burn his poots <span>D</span>away
<br/>
<span>G</span>And all the <span>F</span>while on a <span>Eb</span>shelf in a <span>D</span>shed
<br/>
<span>C</span>Kenny's little creature's <span>Ab</span>on <span>G</span>display
<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>Ronnie saves his <span>Em</span>numies on a <span>Am</span>window in his room
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>A marvel to be <span>Em</span>seen; <span>Fm</span>dysentery <span>G</span>green
<br/>
<span>C</span>While Kenny and his <span>Em</span>buddies had a <span>Am</span>game out in the back
<br/>
<span>F</span>LET'S MAKE THE <span>G</span>WATER TURN <span>Am</span>BLACK!
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Em</span>We see them after school in a <span>A</span>world of their own
<br/>
<span>Em</span>To some it might seem creepy what <span>A</span>they do...
<br/>
<span>Em</span>The neighbors on the right sat and <span>C</span>watched them <span>B</span>every night
<br/>
<span>Em</span>I bet you'd do the same if they was <span>D</span>you
<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>Ronnie's in the <span>Em</span>Army now and <span>Am</span>Kenny's taking pills
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>Oh! How they <span>Em</span>yearn to see a <span>Fm</span>bomber <span>G</span>burn!
<br/>
<span>C</span>Color flashing, <span>Em</span>thunder crashing, <span>Am</span>dynamite machine!
<br/>
<span>F</span>Wait till the <span>G</span>fire turns <span>Am</span>green...
<br/>
<span>F</span>Wait till the <span>G</span>fire turns <span>Am</span>green...
<br/>
<span>F</span>WAIT TILL THE <span>G</span>FIRE TURNS <span>A</span>GREEN!
