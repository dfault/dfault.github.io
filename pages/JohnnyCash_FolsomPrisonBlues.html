<h3>Folsom Prison Blues</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">E</span>I hear the train a comin'
<br/>
It's rolling round the bend
<br/>
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm <span class="chord">A</span>stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin'<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">E</span>on
<br/>
<br/>
But that <span class="chord">B</span>train keeps a rollin' on down to San <span class="chord">E</span>Antone
<br/>

<br/>
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
<br/>
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
<br/>
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
<br/>
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
<br/>

<br/>
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
<br/>
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
<br/>
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
<br/>
But those people keep a movin'
<br/>
And that's what tortures me
<br/>

<br/>
Well if they freed me from this prison,
<br/>
If that railroad train was mine
<br/>
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
<br/>
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
<br/>
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
