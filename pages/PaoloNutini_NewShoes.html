<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>Woke up cold one tuesday,
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C9</span>i'm looking tired and <span class="chord">G</span>feeling quite sick, 
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>i felt like there was something missing in my <span class="chord">C9</span>day to<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp day <span class="chord">E</span>life, 
<br/>
<br/>
so i <span class="chord">A</span>quickly opened the wardrobe, 
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C9</span>pulled out some jeans and a <span class="chord">G</span>T-Shirt that seemed<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp clean, 
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>topped it off with a pair of old shoes, 
<br/>
<br/>
that were <span class="chord">C9</span>ripped around the <span class="chord">E</span>seams,
<br/>
<br/>
and i thought <span class="chord">Dsus2</span>these shoes just don't suit me. 
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>Hey, I put some <span class="chord">E</span>new shoes on, 
<br/>
<br/>
and <span class="chord">Dsus2</span>suddenly everything is right,
<br/>
<br/>
I said, <span class="chord">A</span>hey, I put some <span class="chord">E</span>new shoes on 
<br/>
<br/>
and <span class="chord">Dsus2</span>everybody's smiling, its so inviting, 
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, <span class="chord">A</span>short on money, but <span class="chord">E</span>long on time,
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Dsus2</span>slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
<br/>
<br/>
and <span class="chord">A</span>i'm running late,
<br/>
<br/>
and i dont <span class="chord">E</span>need an excuse,
<br/>
<br/>
'cause i'm <span class="chord">Dsus2</span>wearing my brand new shoes.
<br/>
 
<br/>
 
<br/>
 
<br/>
Woke up late one thursday,
<br/>
i'm seeing stars as i'm rubbing my eyes, 
<br/>
and i felt like there were two days missing, 
<br/>
as i focused on the time,
<br/>
and i made my way to the kitchen,
<br/>
but i had to stop from the shock of what i found,
<br/>
a room full of all my friends dancing round and round,
<br/>
and i thought hello new shoes, byebye blues. 
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>where bright lights and angels m<span class="chord">C9</span>eet, 
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>stone to stone they take me <span class="chord">C9</span>on,  
<br/>
