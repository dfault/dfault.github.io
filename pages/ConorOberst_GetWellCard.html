<br/>
Now they drive the cars up and down the beach
<br/>
It's ridiculous and everybody knows
<br/>
Hear the Mustangs rev at the four way stop
<br/>
You get ghosted when the light says go
<br/>
But in a town like this, in the chequered flag dawn
<br/>
It's so empty you could make somebody dream
<br/>
So maybe it's you, in your four-post bed
<br/>
Found asleep with still blood in your teeth and\ldots
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna be your happiness
<br/>
I wanna be your common sense pain
<br/>
Wrap your head in a picket fence
<br/>
Rebuild after the hurricane
<br/>

<br/>
Right there, that's the postman sleeping in the sand
<br/>
He's got a letter to deliver, but i'm still not mad
<br/>
Right there, that's the postman sleeping in the sand
<br/>
He's got a get-well-card to deliver
<br/>
He's gonna do it by hand,
<br/>
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it
<br/>
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it,
<br/>
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it\ldots by hand
