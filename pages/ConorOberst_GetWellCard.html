<h3>Get-Well-Card</h3>
<h4>Conor Oberst</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  A p<span>G</span>eacock, people left the p<span>Bm</span>lumes in a pile
<br/>
T<span>C</span>hey look good to f<span>Em</span>old
<br/>
And the G<span>G</span>ulf water's warm l<span>Bm</span>ike a bathtub
<br/>
F<span>C</span>ull of lavender and epsom s<span>D</span>alt
<br/>

<br/>
See a b<span>G</span>leach blond boy put his <span>Bm</span>longboard down
<br/>
H<span>C</span>elp his girl get her sunscreen o<span>Em</span>n
<br/>
I t<span>G</span>hought about you in your l<span>Bm</span>ittle house
<br/>
Think you're l<span>C</span>onely but I could be w<span>D</span>rong and\ldots
<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>I wanna be a b<span>D</span>ootlegger
<br/>
W<span>C</span>anna mix you up something s<span>D</span>trange
<br/>
B<span>C</span>raid your hair like a s<span>D</span>ister
<br/>
M<span>C</span>aim you like a hurric<span>D</span>ane
<br/>

<br/>
R<span>G</span>ight there, that's the p<span>D</span>ostman s<span>C</span>leeping in the s<span>Em</span>and
<br/>
H<span>G</span>e's got a letter to del<span>D</span>iver, but I c<span>C</span>an't stay m<span>D</span>ad
<br/>
R<span>G</span>ight there, that's the p<span>D</span>ostman s<span>C</span>leeping in the s<span>Em</span>and
<br/>
He's got a g<span>G</span>et-well-card to del<span>D</span>iver
<br/>
He's gonna d<span>C</span>o it by h<span>D</span>and, he's gonna d<span>C</span>o it by h<span>D</span>and
<br/>

<br/>
Now they drive the cars up and down the beach
<br/>
It's ridiculous and everybody knows
<br/>
Hear the Mustangs rev at the four way stop
<br/>
You get ghosted when the light says go
<br/>
But in a town like this, in the chequered flag dawn
<br/>
It's so empty you could make somebody dream
<br/>
So maybe it's you, in your four-post bed
<br/>
Found asleep with still blood in your teeth and\ldots
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna be your happiness
<br/>
I wanna be your common sense pain
<br/>
Wrap your head in a picket fence
<br/>
Rebuild after the hurricane
<br/>

<br/>
Right there, that's the postman sleeping in the sand
<br/>
He's got a letter to deliver, but i'm still not mad
<br/>
Right there, that's the postman sleeping in the sand
<br/>
He's got a get-well-card to deliver
<br/>
He's gonna do it by hand,
<br/>
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it
<br/>
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it,
<br/>
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it\ldots by hand
