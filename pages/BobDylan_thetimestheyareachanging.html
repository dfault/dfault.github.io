<h3>the times they are a-changing</h3>
<h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Come <span>G</span>gather 'round <span>Em</span>people wher<span>C</span>ever you <span>G</span>roam
<br/>
And ad<span>G</span>mit that the <span>Em</span>waters <span>C</span>around you have <span>D</span>grown
<br/>
And ac<span>G</span>cept it that <span>Em</span>soon you'll be <span>C</span>drenched to the <span>G</span>bone
<br/>
If your <span>G</span>time to <span>Am</span>you is worth <span>D</span>savin'
<br/>
So you better start sw<span>C9</span>imming or you'll <span>G/B</span>sink like a <span>D/A</span>stone
<br/>
For the <span>G</span>times, they are <span>C</span>a-chang -<span>D</span> i<span>G</span>n'
<br/>

<br/>
Come writers and critics who prophecies with your pen
<br/>
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
<br/>
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
<br/>
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
<br/>
For the loser now will be later to win
<br/>
For the times they are a-chang-in'
<br/>

<br/>
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
<br/>
And don't criticize what you don't understand
<br/>
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
<br/>
Your old road is rapidly agin'
<br/>
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand
<br/>
For the times they are a-changin'
<br/>

<br/>
Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
<br/>
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
<br/>
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
<br/>
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
<br/>
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
<br/>
For the times they are a-changin'
<br/>

<br/>
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
<br/>
The slow one now will later be fast
<br/>
As the present now will later be past
<br/>
The order is rapidly fadin'
<br/>
And the first one now will later be last
<br/>
For the times they are a-changin'
