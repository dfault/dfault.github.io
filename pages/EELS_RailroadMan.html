<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>Feel like an old <span>G/B</span>railroad man
<br/>
<span>F</span>Ridin' out on the <span>Am</span>bluemont <span>G</span>line
<br/>
<span>C</span>Hummin' along old dom<span>G/B</span>inion blues
<br/>
<span>F</span>Not much to see and <span>Am</span>not much left to <span>G</span>lose
<br/>
And i <span>F</span>know i can walk along the <span>C</span>tracks
<br/>
It may <span>Em</span>take a little longer but i'll <span>F</span>know
<br/>
How to <span>G</span>find my way <span>C</span>back
<br/>

<br/>
I feel like an old railroad man
<br/>
Who's really tried the best that he can
<br/>
To make his life add up to something good
<br/>
But this engine no longer burns on wood
<br/>
And i guess i may never understand
<br/>
The times that i live in
<br/>
Are not made for a railroad man
<br/>

<br/>
I feel like an old railroad man
<br/>
Getting on board at the end of an age
<br/>
The station's empty and the whistle blows
<br/>
Things are faster now
<br/>
And this train is just too slow
<br/>
And i know i can walk along the tracks
<br/>
It may take a little longer but i'll know
<br/>
How to find my way back
