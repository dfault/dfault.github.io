<br/>
I feel like an old railroad man
<br/>
Who's really tried the best that he can
<br/>
To make his life add up to something good
<br/>
But this engine no longer burns on wood
<br/>
And i guess i may never understand
<br/>
The times that i live in
<br/>
Are not made for a railroad man
<br/>

<br/>
I feel like an old railroad man
<br/>
Getting on board at the end of an age
<br/>
The station's empty and the whistle blows
<br/>
Things are faster now
<br/>
And this train is just too slow
<br/>
And i know i can walk along the tracks
<br/>
It may take a little longer but i'll know
<br/>
How to find my way back
