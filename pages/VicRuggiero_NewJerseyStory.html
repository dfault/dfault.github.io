<h3>New Jersey Story</h3>
<h4>Vic Ruggiero</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
Well, J<span class="chord">G</span>ohnny and the neighbors talk about fire
<br/>
<br/>
O<span class="chord">C</span>utside the old front door
<br/>
<br/>
My g<span class="chord">H</span>irl says ''Please, would you put down the phone?''
<br/>
<br/>
And st<span class="chord">C</span>amps her feet for m<span class="chord">G</span>ore
<br/>

<br/>
Bobby's in the fridge, lookin' pensive, he says,
<br/>
''My, your beer looks expensive!
<br/>
''You don't even drink it, man
<br/>
''Who'd you buy it for?''
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And I said, ''Wh<span class="chord">E</span>at you gonna do when your dreams come<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp true? H<span class="chord">A</span>uh?''
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you pr<span class="chord">C</span>obably won't have n<span class="chord">D</span>othin' more to s<span class="chord">G</span>ay
<br/>
<br/>
''Wh<span class="chord">E</span>at you gonna do when your dreams come true 
<br/>
<br/>
if I m<span class="chord">A</span>ake your dream come true for you?
<br/>
<br/>
''W<span class="chord">C</span>ill you tell me th<span class="chord">D</span>at you'll go aw<span class="chord">G</span>ay?''
<br/>

<br/>
See, I look like a poet and I don't even know it
<br/>
'Til somebody tells me so
<br/>
They say, ''Hey Tom Sawyer, how's your lawyer?''
<br/>
I said, ''Rich, far as I know''
<br/>

<br/>
They say, ''Hey Hem the Wayman, what do you say?
<br/>
''Why you look so glum for?''
<br/>
I said, ''The basket and the dryer never line up right
<br/>
''And all my clean clothes fall on the floor''
<br/>

<br/>
And I said, ''What you gonna do when your dreams come true?<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp Huh?''
<br/>
Well, you probably won't have nothin' more to say
<br/>
''What you gonna do when your dreams come true 
<br/>
if I make your dream come true for you?
<br/>
''Will you tell me that you'll go away?''
<br/>

<br/>
Y'know I found a genie in a lamp when the weather was damp
<br/>
In nineteen eighty-four
<br/>
But I put it on a shelf and I kept it to myself
<br/>
'Cause I didn't know what to wish for
<br/>

<br/>
In nineteen ninety-nine, the weather was fine
<br/>
And they said the world was gonna end
<br/>
So I rubbed that lamp and I made a little wish
<br/>
And we all woke up again
<br/>

<br/>
And I said, ''What you gonna do when your dreams come true?<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp Huh?''
<br/>
Well, you probably won't have nothin' more to say
<br/>
''What you gonna do when your dreams come true 
<br/>
if I make your dream come true for you?
<br/>
''Will you tell me that you'll go away?''
<br/>

<br/>
''If I make your dream come true for you today?
<br/>
''Honey, if I make your dream come true for you today?
<br/>
''Oh, if I make your dream come true for you today?''
