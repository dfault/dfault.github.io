<br/>
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
<br/>
I spent the night in utah in a cave up in the hills.
<br/>

<br/>
Set out runnin but I take my time, a friend of the devil is<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp a friend of mine,
<br/>
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp tonight.
<br/>

<br/>
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
<br/>
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.
<br/>

<br/>
Set out runnin but I take my time
<br/>
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
<br/>
If I get home before daylight
<br/>
I just might get some sleep tonight.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">D</span>Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">Am</span>first ones named sweet anne marie, and shes my<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp hearts delight.
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">D</span>second one is prison, babe, the sheriffs on my<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp trail,
<br/>
<br/>
And <span class="chord">Am</span>if he catches up with me, I'll <span class="chord">C</span>spend my life in<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">D</span>jail.
<br/>

<br/>
Got a wife in chino, babe, and one in cherokee
<br/>
The first one says shes got my child, but it dont look like<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp me.
<br/>

<br/>
Set out runnin but I take my time,
<br/>
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
<br/>
If I get home before daylight
<br/>
I just might get some sleep tonight.
