<h3>Make it wit chu</h3>
<h4>Queens of the Stone Age</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>
You wanna know if I know why?
<br/>
I can't say that I do,
<br/>
I don't understand the evil eye,
<br/>
Or how one becomes two.
<br/>
And I just can't recall what started it all,
<br/>
Or how to begin in the end,
<br/>
I ain't here to break it,
<br/>
Just see how far it will bend,
<br/>
Again and again,
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna make it,
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
Anytime, anywhere,
<br/>
I wanna make it,
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes the same is different,
<br/>
but mostly it's the same
<br/>
these mysteries of life, that just ain't my thing
<br/>
if I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon,
<br/>
I'd be untrue,
<br/>
The only thing I know for sure
<br/>
Is what I wanna do,
<br/>
anytime, anywhere and I say
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna make it, (again and again)
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
Anytime, anywhere,
<br/>
I wanna make it, (again and again)
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
I wanna make it, (anytime, anywhere)
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
I wanna make it,
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu.
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna make it, (again and again)
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
I wanna make it, (anytime, anywhere)
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
I wanna make it, (again and again)
<br/>
I wanna make it wit chu,
<br/>
I wanna make it, (again and again and again and again and<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp again..)
