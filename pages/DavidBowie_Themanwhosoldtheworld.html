<h3>The man who sold the world</h3>
<h4>David Bowie</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>(Dm)</span>We passed upon the st<span>A7</span>airs, We spoke of was and <span>Dm</span>when
<br/>
Although I wasn't t<span>A7</span>here, he said i was his f<span>F</span>riend
<br/>
Which came as some surpr<span>C</span>ise, I spoke into his <span>A</span>eyes
<br/>
I thought you died al<span>Dm</span>one, a long long time ag<span>C</span>o
<br/>

<br/>
Oh n<span>C</span>o,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not m<span>F</span>e
<br/>
I n<span>Bbm</span>ever lost contr<span>F</span>ol
<br/>
Your'e f<span>C</span>ace      to f<span>F</span>ace
<br/>
with the m<span>Bbm</span>an who sold the w<span>A</span>orld
<br/>

<br/>
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
<br/>
I searched for form and land, for years and years i roamed
<br/>
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
<br/>
We must have died alone' a long long time ago
<br/>

<br/>
Who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not me
<br/>
We never lost control
<br/>
Your'e face to face
<br/>
with the man who sold the world
