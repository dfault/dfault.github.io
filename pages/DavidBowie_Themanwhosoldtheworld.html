<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
<span class="chord">(Dm)</span>We passed upon the st<span class="chord">A7</span>airs, We spoke of was and<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">Dm</span>when
<br/>
<br/>
Although I wasn't t<span class="chord">A7</span>here, he said i was his f<span class="chord">F</span>riend
<br/>
<br/>
Which came as some surpr<span class="chord">C</span>ise, I spoke into his <span class="chord">A</span>eyes
<br/>
<br/>
I thought you died al<span class="chord">Dm</span>one, a long long time ag<span class="chord">C</span>o
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh n<span class="chord">C</span>o,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not m<span class="chord">F</span>e
<br/>
<br/>
I n<span class="chord">Bbm</span>ever lost contr<span class="chord">F</span>ol
<br/>
<br/>
Your'e f<span class="chord">C</span>ace      to f<span class="chord">F</span>ace
<br/>
<br/>
with the m<span class="chord">Bbm</span>an who sold the w<span class="chord">A</span>orld
<br/>

<br/>
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
<br/>
I searched for form and land, for years and years i roamed
<br/>
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
<br/>
We must have died alone' a long long time ago
<br/>

<br/>
Who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not me
<br/>
We never lost control
<br/>
Your'e face to face
<br/>
with the man who sold the world
