<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>It's a <span class="chord">G</span>mystery to <span class="chord">Am</span>me
<br/>
<br/>
we have a <span class="chord">C</span>greed with <span class="chord">F</span>which we have <span class="chord">G</span>agreed
<br/>
<br/>
You <span class="chord">F</span>think you have to <span class="chord">G</span>want more than you <span class="chord">Am</span>need
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>until you have it <span class="chord">G</span>all you won't <span class="chord">Am</span>be free
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>society, you're a crazy <span class="chord">C</span>breed
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're not <span class="chord">G</span>lonely without <span class="chord">Am</span>me
<br/>

<br/>
When you want more than you have you think you need
<br/>
and when you think more than you want your thoughts begin to<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp bleed
<br/>
I think I need to find a bigger place
<br/>
cause when you have more than you think you need more space
<br/>

<br/>
society, you're a crazy breed
<br/>
I hope you're not lonely without me
<br/>
society, crazy and deep
<br/>
I hope you're not lonely without me
<br/>

<br/>
there's those thinking more or less less is more
<br/>
but if less is more how you're keeping score?
<br/>
Means for every point you make your level drops
<br/>
kinda like its starting from the top
<br/>
you can't do that...
<br/>

<br/>
society, you're a crazy breed
<br/>
I hope you're not lonely without me
<br/>
society, crazy and deep
<br/>
I hope you're not lonely without me
<br/>

<br/>
society, have mercy on me
<br/>
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
<br/>
society, crazy and deep
<br/>
I hope you're not lonely without me
<br/>
