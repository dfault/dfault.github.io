<h3>Wish You Were Here</h3>
<h4>Pink Floyd</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
S<span class="chord">C</span>o, so you think you can t<span class="chord">D</span>ell,
<br/>
<br/>
Heaven from H<span class="chord">Am</span>ell, blue skies from p<span class="chord">G</span>ain.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell a green f<span class="chord">D</span>ield from a cold steel r<span class="chord">C</span>ail, a<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp smile from a v<span class="chord">Am</span>eil,
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think you can t<span class="chord">G</span>ell?
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And did they get you to tr<span class="chord">C</span>ade your heroes for gh<span class="chord">D</span>osts,
<br/>
<br/>
Hot ashes for t<span class="chord">Am</span>rees, hot air for a cool b<span class="chord">G</span>reeze, cold<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp comfort for ch<span class="chord">D</span>ange,
<br/>
<br/>
And did you exch<span class="chord">C</span>ange a walk on part in the w<span class="chord">Am</span>ar for a<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp lead role in a c<span class="chord">G</span>age?
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
H<span class="chord">C</span>ow I wish, how I wish you were h<span class="chord">D</span>ere.
<br/>
<br/>
We're just tw<span class="chord">Am</span>o lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp y<span class="chord">G</span>ear after year,
<br/>
<br/>
R<span class="chord">D</span>unning over the same old ground. Wh<span class="chord">C</span>at have we found?
<br/>
<br/>
The same old f<span class="chord">Am</span>ears. Wish you were her<span class="chord">G</span>e!
