<h3>Wish You Were Here</h3>
<h4>Pink Floyd</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  S<span>C</span>o, so you think you can t<span>D</span>ell,
<br/>
Heaven from H<span>Am</span>ell, blue skies from p<span>G</span>ain.
<br/>
Can you tell a green f<span>D</span>ield from a cold steel r<span>C</span>ail, a smile from a v<span>Am</span>eil,
<br/>
Do you think you can t<span>G</span>ell?
<br/>

<br/>
And did they get you to tr<span>C</span>ade your heroes for gh<span>D</span>osts,
<br/>
Hot ashes for t<span>Am</span>rees, hot air for a cool b<span>G</span>reeze, cold comfort for ch<span>D</span>ange,
<br/>
And did you exch<span>C</span>ange a walk on part in the w<span>Am</span>ar for a lead role in a c<span>G</span>age?
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
H<span>C</span>ow I wish, how I wish you were h<span>D</span>ere.
<br/>
We're just tw<span>Am</span>o lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, y<span>G</span>ear after year,
<br/>
R<span>D</span>unning over the same old ground. Wh<span>C</span>at have we found?
<br/>
The same old f<span>Am</span>ears. Wish you were her<span>G</span>e!
<br/>
