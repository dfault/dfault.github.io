<br/>
Yeah
<br/>
It goes away.
<br/>
All of this and more of no-thing in my life.
<br/>
No

Color clay.
<br/>
Indi-vidu-ali-ty not safe.

<br/>
As of now I beg you got me wrong.
<br/>
So unsure you run from something strong.
<br/>

<br/>
I
<br/>
Can't let go.
<br/>
Threadbare tapestry un-winding slow.
<br/>
Feel
<br/>
A tortured brain.
<br/>
Show your belly like you want me to.
<br/>

<br/>
As of now I beg you got me wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
So unsure you run from something s<span class="chord">G#</span>trooo<span class="chord">F#</span>oooo<span class="chord">A</span>ng.

I haven't f<span class="chord">E</span>elt like th<span class="chord">F#</span>is in so l<span class="chord">A</span>ong.
<br/>
<br/>
W<span class="chord">G#</span>rooo<span class="chord">F#</span>oooo<span class="chord">A</span>ng.
<br/>

<br/>
In a sense, too far gone from love.
<br/>
That won't last for-ever.
<br/>
Something's gotta turn out right.
<br/>

<br/>
You
<br/>
Sugar taste.
<br/>
Sweetness doesn't of-ten touch my face.
<br/>
Stay
<br/>
If you please.
<br/>
You may not be here when I leave.
<br/>

I haven't felt like this in so long.
