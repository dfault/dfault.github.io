Her husband, was a hard working man
<br/>
Just about a mile from here
<br/>
His head was found in a driving wheel 
<br/>
But his body never was found
<br/>

<br/>
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
<br/>
Tell me where did you sleep last night
<br/>
In the pines, in the pines
<br/>
Where the sun don't ever shine
<br/>
I would shiver the whole night through
<br/>

<br/>
My girl, my girl, where will you go
<br/>
I'm going where the cold wind blows
<br/>
In the pines, in the pines
<br/>
Where the sun don't ever shine
<br/>
I would shiver the whole night through
<br/>

<br/>
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
<br/>
Tell me where did you sleep last night
<br/>
In the pines, in the pines
<br/>
Where the sun don't ever shine
<br/>
I would shiver the whole night through

<br/>
My girl, my girl, where will ya go
<br/>
I'm going where the cold wind blows
<br/>
In the pines, the pines
<br/>
The sun, the shine
<br/>
I'll shiver the whole night through
