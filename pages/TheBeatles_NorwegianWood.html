  <span>D</span>I once had a girl, or should I say
<br/>
sh<span>C</span>e once had m<span>D</span>e.
<br/>
Sh<span>D</span>e showed me her room, isn't it good?
<br/>
N<span>C</span>orwegian w<span>D</span>ood.
<br/>

<br/>
She <span>Dm</span>asked my to stay and told me to sit <span>G</span>anywhere,
<br/>
So <span>Dm</span>I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a <span>Em</span>cha<span>A/A7</span>ir.
<br/>

<br/>
<span>D</span>I sat on a rug, biding my time,
<br/>
dr<span>C</span>inking her w<span>D</span>ine.
<br/>
W<span>D</span>e talked until two, and then she said,
<br/>
<span>C</span>It's time for b<span>D</span>ed.
<br/>

<br/>
She t<span>Dm</span>old me she worked in the morning and started to l<span>G</span>augh,
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the <span>em</span>ba<span>A/A7</span>th.
<br/>

<br/>
<span>D</span>And when I awoke, I was alone, th<span>C</span>is bird has fl<span>D</span>own.
<br/>
So <span>D</span>I lit a fire, isn't it good?
<br/>
N<span>C</span>orwegian w<span>D</span>ood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<span>C</span>}<span>D</span>{<span>C</span>}<span>Dm7</span>{}<span>D</span>
