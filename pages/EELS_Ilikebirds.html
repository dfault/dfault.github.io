I don't care for walking downtown
<br/>
crazy autocar gonna mow me down
<br/>
and look at all those people like cows in a herd
<br/>
but I like... birds
<br/>

<br/>
If you're small and on a search
<br/>
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
<br/>

<br/>
I can't stand the line at the store
<br/>
you mean little people are such a bore
<br/>
but its alright if you act like a turd
<br/>
cause I like... birds
<br/>

<br/>
If you're small and on a search 
<br/>
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
