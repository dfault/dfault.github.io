<h3>Sever</h3>
<h4>Karate</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Your eyes, they made lies true
<br/>
Say anything and I would believe you
<br/>
But there were demons, maybe more than a few
<br/>
So what could we do?
<br/>
Because in my life there was only asbestos
<br/>
And Raymond Williams, you always took the best ones
<br/>
Now, like failed pedestrian dreams
<br/>
That's how it seems to me.
<br/>

<br/>
Once again, back out on the highway
<br/>
Watch the traffic-you know it's a Friday
<br/>
And all the seats-belts in all the vans
<br/>
Won't change your plans
<br/>
You can get by on a few sins
<br/>
And you can try to make a horse win once
<br/>
Cut you can't put back together what you sever
<br/>

<br/>
The rain comes down and turns your shine back to rust, yeah
<br/>
Does that mean that you have to sever us?
<br/>
Someday some shit will come around and reverse the earth, turn your flesh back to dust
<br/>
Unless you hold on to something forever
<br/>

Hold on to something forever
<br/>
Hold on to something forever
<br/>
Forever
