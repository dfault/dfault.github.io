<br/>
peter patrick pitter patters on the window
<br/>
but sunny silhouette wont let him in
<br/>
poor old petes got nothing because hes been falling
<br/>
somehow sunny knows just where hes been
<br/>
he thinks that singing on sunday is gonna save his soul
<br/>
now that saturday is gone
<br/>
sometimes he thinks that hes on his way
<br/>
but i can see 
<br/>
that his break lights are on
<br/>

<br/>
He just wanders around, unaffected by
<br/>
the winter winds and he'll pretend that
<br/>
he's somewhere else, so far and clear
<br/>
about two thousand miles from here
<br/>

<br/>
such a tough enchilada filled up with nada
<br/>
giving what she gotta give to get a dollar bill
<br/>
used to be a limber chicken, times a been a ticking
<br/>
nows shes finger licking to the man
<br/>
with the money in his pocket flying in his rocket
<br/>
only stopping by on his way to a better world
<br/>
<span>C</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>D</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>F</span>if t<span>G</span>aylor finds a better world
<br/>
<span>C</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>D</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>F</span>then t<span>G</span>aylor's gonna run away
<br/>
