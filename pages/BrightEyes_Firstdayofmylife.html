<h3>First day of my life</h3>
<h4>Bright Eyes</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>This is the <span class="chord">E</span>first day of my <span class="chord">Am</span>life
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>Swear I was <span class="chord">G</span>born right in the <span class="chord">C</span>doorway
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>I went out in the <span class="chord">E</span>rain, suddenly everything<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp ch<span class="chord">Am</span>anged
<br/>
<br/>
They're spreading <span class="chord">D7</span>blankets on the <span class="chord">G</span>beac<span class="chord">G9</span>h
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Yours is the <span class="chord">E</span>first face that I <span class="chord">Am</span>saw
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>Think I was <span class="chord">G</span>blind before I <span class="chord">C</span>met you
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Don't know where I <span class="chord">E</span>am, don't know where I've <span class="chord">Am</span>been
<br/>
<br/>
But I <span class="chord">D7</span>know where I want to <span class="chord">G</span>go
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So I <span class="chord">C</span>thought I'd <span class="chord">G</span>let you <span class="chord">Am</span>know
<br/>
<br/>
That <span class="chord">F</span>these things take for<span class="chord">G</span>ever
<br/>
<br/>
I esp<span class="chord">C</span>eciall<span class="chord">C/B</span>y am <span class="chord">Am</span>slow
<br/>
<br/>
But <span class="chord">Dminsus2</span>I realized how I need you and I wondered if I<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp could come h<span class="chord">C</span>ome 
<br/>

<br/>
G|Am|Dminsus2|Fminsus2|Fminsus2
<br/>

<br/>
I remember the time you drove all night 
<br/>
Just to meet me in the morning 
<br/>
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed 
<br/>
You felt as if you'd just woke up 
<br/>

<br/>
And you said, "This is the first day of my life.
<br/>
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
<br/>
Now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
<br/>
And I'd probably be happy.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So if <span class="chord">C</span>you want <span class="chord">G</span>to be with <span class="chord">Am</span>me 
<br/>
<br/>
With <span class="chord">F</span>these things there's <span class="chord">G</span>no telling 
<br/>
<br/>
We'll just <span class="chord">C</span>have to <span class="chord">C/B</span>wait and <span class="chord">Am</span>see
<br/>
<br/>
But I'd <span class="chord">Dminsus2</span>rather be working for a paycheck than<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp waiting to win the lotter<span class="chord">C</span>y 
<br/>

<br/>
E|Am
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Besides, <span class="chord">Dminsus2</span>maybe this time its different, I mean I<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp really think you <span class="chord">C</span>like me
<br/>
E|Am
<br/>
Dminsus2|Fminsus2|Fminsus2
<br/>
C|E|Am
<br/>
