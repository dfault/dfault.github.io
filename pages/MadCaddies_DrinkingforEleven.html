<span class="chord">F</span>Drinking for eleven, that's just what I <span class="chord">A</span>do,
<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not with <span class="chord">Bb</span>you, <span class="chord">Bbm</span>my heart goes to <span class="chord">F</span>bed.
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>End of the bar, that's just where I'll <span class="chord">A</span>be,
<br/>
<br/>
Don't try and come find <span class="chord">Bb</span>me, cause <span class="chord">Bbm</span>I'm already<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">F</span>dead
<br/>

<br/>
With one eye tied upon the open road,
<br/>
I feel your presence and I can't let it go.
<br/>
It moves so slowly as it creeps into my mind,
<br/>
Steals every breath I have and leaves my heart behind
<br/>

<br/>
Wanna know what you're feeling if your feeling alone
<br/>
I wanna hear if you still care
<br/>
The last time I remember you was the last time I wasn't<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp scared
<br/>

<br/>
When the nights start fading and the mornin' arrives
<br/>
I wanna still feel you around
<br/>
Will you creep into my head again and pick me up off the<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp ground
<br/>
Once more, tell me what you're fighting for
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>Gotta try gotta <span class="chord">C</span>try for tom<span class="chord">Dm</span>orrow <span class="chord">Bb</span><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>When you <span class="chord">C</span>can't see through tod<span class="chord">Dm</span>ay <span class="chord">Bb</span><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>Gotta try, gotta <span class="chord">C</span>try for tom<span class="chord">Dm</span>orrow <span class="chord">Bb</span><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>When you <span class="chord">C</span>can't see through tod<span class="chord">Dm</span>ay
<br/>
<br/>
There's nowhere left to <span class="chord">Bb</span>stay
<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes it feels like I'm out here all alone
<br/>
Just one in million stuck with no place left to go
<br/>
The fear steps up to me with every move that I make
<br/>
Following close behind my soul it wants to take
<br/>
Wanna know what you're feeling if your feeling alone
<br/>
I wanna hear if you still care
<br/>
The last time I remember you was the last time I wasn't<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp scared
<br/>

<br/>
When the nights start fading and the mornin' arrives
<br/>
I wanna still feel you around
<br/>
Will you creep into my head again and pick me up off the<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp ground
<br/>
Once more, tell me what you're fighting for
<br/>

<br/>
Gotta try gotta try for tomorrow
<br/>
When you can't see through today
<br/>
Gotta try, gotta try for tomorrow
<br/>
When you can't see through today
<br/>
There's nowhere left to stay
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>

<br/>
Drinking for a living, that's just what I do,
<br/>
When I'm not with you,
<br/>
My heart goes to bed
