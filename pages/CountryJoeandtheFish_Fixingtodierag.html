<br/>
<span>G</span>Uncle Sam needs your help again
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>way down yonder in Viet Nam so
<br/>
<span>E7</span>put down your books and p<span>A7</span>ick up a gun we're
<br/>
<span>D7</span>gonna have a whole lotta f<span>G</span>un
<br/>

<br/>
And it's <span>D/E</span>one, <span>D/F</span>two, <span>D/F#</span>three, what are we <span>G</span>fighting for
<br/>
don't ask me I <span>D7</span>don't give a damn, next stop is <span>G</span>Viet Nam
<br/>
And it's <span>D/E</span>five, <span>D/F</span>six, <span>D/F#</span>seven, open up the <span>G</span>pearly gates
<br/>
<span>E7</span>ain't no time to <span>A7</span>wonder why, <span>D7</span>whoopee we're all gonna <span>G</span>die
<br/>

<br/>
come on generals, let's move fast
<br/>
your big chance has come at last
<br/>
now you can go out and get those reds
<br/>
cos the only good commie is the one that's dead and
<br/>
you know that peace can only be won when we've
<br/>
blown 'em all to kingdom come
<br/>

<br/>
come on wall street don't be slow
<br/>
why man this war is a go-go
<br/>
there's plenty good money to be made by
<br/>
supplying the army with the tools of its trade
<br/>
let's hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,
<br/>
they drop it on the Viet Cong
<br/>

<br/>
come on mothers throughout the land
<br/>
pack your boys off to Viet Nam
<br/>
come on fathers don't hesitate
<br/>
send your sons off before it's too late
<br/>
and you can be the first ones on your block
<br/>
to have your boy come home in a box
