<br/>
come on generals, let's move fast
<br/>
your big chance has come at last
<br/>
now you can go out and get those reds
<br/>
cos the only good commie is the one that's dead and
<br/>
you know that peace can only be won when we've
<br/>
blown 'em all to kingdom come
<br/>

<br/>
come on wall street don't be slow
<br/>
why man this war is a go-go
<br/>
there's plenty good money to be made by
<br/>
supplying the army with the tools of its trade
<br/>
let's hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,
<br/>
they drop it on the Viet Cong
<br/>

<br/>
come on mothers throughout the land
<br/>
pack your boys off to Viet Nam
<br/>
come on fathers don't hesitate
<br/>
send your sons off before it's too late
<br/>
and you can be the first ones on your block
<br/>
to have your boy come home in a box
