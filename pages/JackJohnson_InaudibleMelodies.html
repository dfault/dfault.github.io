<h3>Inaudible Melodies</h3>
<h4>Jack Johnson</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Brushfire fi<span>F#</span>airytales
<br/>
Itsy b<span>B</span>itsy diamond rings
<br/>
Bi<span>F#</span>g fat hurricanes
<br/>
Yellow b<span>B</span>elly given names
<br/>
Well shortcuts c<span>C#</span>an slow you down
<br/>
And in the end we're b<span>B</span>ound
<br/>
To rebound off of w<span>F#</span>e &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>C#</span>
<br/>
Well dust off y<span>F#</span>our thinking caps 
<br/>
solar powered plast<span>B</span>ic plants
<br/>
Pretty pictures of th<span>F#</span>ings we ate
<br/>
we are only wh<span>B</span>at we hate
<br/>
But in the long run <span>C#</span>we have found
<br/>
silent films are f<span>B</span>ull of sound
<br/>
Inaudibly f<span>F##</span>ree {}<span>C#7</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Sl<span>F#</span>ow down everyone 
<br/>
yo<span>Bb</span>u're moving too fast
<br/>
Fr<span>B</span>ames can't catch you when you're
<br/>
m<span>G#7</span>oving like that
<br/>

<br/>
Inaudible melodies
<br/>
Severe narrational strategies
<br/>
Unobtrusive tones help to
<br/>
notice nothing but the zone
<br/>
Of visual relevancy
<br/>
Frame lines tell me what too see
<br/>
Chopping like an axe and maybe
<br/>
Eisenstein should just relax
<br/>

<br/>
Slow down everyone 
<br/>
you're moving too fast
<br/>
Frames can't catch you when you're
<br/>
moving like that
<br/>

<br/>
Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
<br/>
demanding refunds for the things they've seen
<br/>
I wish they could believe
<br/>
In all the things that never made the screen and
<br/>

<br/>
Slow down everyone 
<br/>
you're moving too fast
<br/>
Frames can't catch you when you're
<br/>
moving like that
