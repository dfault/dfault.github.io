Well shortcuts c<span class="chord">C#</span>an slow you down

<br/>
And in the end we're b<span class="chord">B</span>ound
<br/>
<br/>
To rebound off of w<span class="chord">F#</span>e   <span class="chord">C#</span>{}

<br/>
Well dust off y<span class="chord">F#</span>our thinking caps

Pretty pictures of th<span class="chord">F#</span>ings we ate

<br/>
we are only wh<span class="chord">B</span>at we hate

<br/>
But in the long run <span class="chord">C#</span>we have found

<br/>
m<span class="chord">G#7</span>oving like that
<br/>

<br/>
Inaudible melodies
<br/>
Severe narrational strategies
<br/>
Unobtrusive tones help to
<br/>
notice nothing but the zone
<br/>
Of visual relevancy
<br/>
Frame lines tell me what too see
<br/>
Chopping like an axe and maybe
<br/>
Eisenstein should just relax
<br/>

<br/>
Slow down everyone 
<br/>
you're moving too fast
<br/>
Frames can't catch you when you're
<br/>
moving like that
<br/>

<br/>
Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
<br/>
demanding refunds for the things they've seen
<br/>
I wish they could believe
<br/>
In all the things that never made the screen and
<br/>

<br/>
Slow down everyone 
<br/>
you're moving too fast
<br/>
Frames can't catch you when you're
<br/>
moving like that
