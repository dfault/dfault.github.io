<br/>
<span>Am</span>Bad luck wind been <span>D</span>blowing at my <span>Am</span>back
<br/>
I was <span>D</span>born to bring trouble to <span>C</span>wherever I'm <span>Am</span>at 
<br/>
Got the <span>Am</span>number thirteen <span>D</span>tattooed on my <span>Am</span>neck
<br/>
When the <span>D</span>ink starts to itch, then the <span>C</span>black will turn to <span>Am</span>red
<br/>

<br/>
I was <span>D</span>born in the soul of <span>Am</span>misery
<br/>
<span>D</span>Never had me a <span>Am</span>name
<br/>
<span>D</span>They just gave me the <span>C</span>number when <span>G</span>I was <span>Am</span>young
<br/>

<br/>
Got a long line of heartache
<br/>
I carry it well
<br/>
The list of lives
<br/>
I've broken reach from here to hell
<br/>
Back luck been blowing at my back
<br/>
I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back
<br/>

<br/>
I was born in the soul of misery
<br/>
Never had me a name
<br/>
They just gave me the number when I was young
<br/>

<br/>
I was born in the soul of misery
<br/>
Never had me a name
<br/>
They just gave me the number when I was young
<br/>
They just gave me the number when I was young
