<h3>When I was young</h3>
<h4>The Animals</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  The rooms were so much colder then, my father was a soldier then,
<br/>
and times were very hard, when I was young.   When I was young.
<br/>

<br/>
I smoked my first cigarette at ten, and for girls I had a bad yearn,
<br/>
and I had quite a ball when I was young.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Em D
<br/>

<br/>
When I was <span>G</span>young it was <span>Em</span>more important,
<br/>
<span>G</span>pain, more pain, but I <span>Em</span>laughed so much louder, <span>D</span>yeah !
<br/>
When I was <span>Em</span>young.    When <span>D</span>I was <span>Em</span>young.
<br/>

<br/>
 
<br/>
I met my first love at thirteen, she was brown and I was pretty green,
<br/>
and I learned quite a lot, when I was young.   When I was young
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
When <span>Bb</span>I was young it was <span>Gm</span>more important,
<br/>
<span>Bb</span>pain, more pain, but I <span>Gm</span>laughed so much louder, <span>F</span>yeah !
<br/>
When I was <span>Gm</span>young.    When <span>F</span>I was <span>Gm</span>young.
<br/>

<br/>
My <span>Gm</span>faith was so much <span>F</span>stronger then, <span>Gm</span>I believed in <span>F</span>fellow men,
<br/>
and <span>Gm</span>I was so much <span>F</span>older then -
<br/>
when <span>F</span>I was <span>Gm</span>young,     
<br/>
when <span>F</span>I was <span>Gm</span>young,     
<br/>
when <span>F</span>I was <span>Gm</span>young..
