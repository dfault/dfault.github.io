<br/>
<br/>
There <span class="chord">Am</span>was a wealthy <span class="chord">C</span>merchant, in London he did<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">E7</span>dwell
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="chord">Am</span>Oh the <span class="chord">E7</span>truth to you we'll <span class="chord">Am</span>tell
<br/>

<br/>
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
<br/>
But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever be
<br/>
Oh her true love ever be
<br/>

<br/>
Jackie's gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind
<br/>
He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
<br/>
Oh his darling girl behind
<br/>

<br/>
She went down to a tailor shop and dressed in man's array
<br/>
She climbed on board a vessel to convey herself away
<br/>
Oh convey herself away
<br/>

<br/>
Before you get on board sir, your name we'd like to know
<br/>
She smiled on her countenance, they called me Jack-A-Roe
<br/>
Oh they called me Jack-A-Roe
<br/>

<br/>
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
<br/>
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
<br/>
Oh to face the cannonball
<br/>

<br/>
I know my waist's to slender, my fingers they are small
<br/>
but it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
<br/>
Oh to see ten thousand fall
<br/>

<br/>
The war soon being over she went and looked around
<br/>
among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
<br/>
Oh her darling boy she found
<br/>

<br/>
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp town
<br/>
she sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
<br/>
Oh to quickly heal his wounds
<br/>

<br/>
This couple they got married so well they did agree
<br/>
This couple they got married so why not you and me?
<br/>
Oh why not you and me?
<br/>
Oh why not you and me?
