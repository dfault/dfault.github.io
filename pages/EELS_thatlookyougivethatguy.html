<h3>that look you give that guy</h3>
<h4>EELS</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>C</span>I never th<span>C/B</span>ought that I could b<span>Bb</span>e so bold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>A</span>
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>To even s<span>Dm/C</span>ay these thoughts a<span>G7/B</span>loud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>G7</span>
<br/>
<span>C</span>I see you w<span>C/B</span>ith your man, your e<span>Bb</span>yes just shine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>A</span>
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>While he stands t<span>Dm/C</span>all and walking p<span>G7/B</span>roud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>G7</span>
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd never let you down
<br/>

<br/>
It always seems like you're going somewhere
<br/>
Better than you've been before
<br/>
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
<br/>
Of you knocking at my door
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd be all I can be, I'd be all I can be
<br/>

<br/>
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
<br/>
I'm nothing much I know it's true
<br/>
I lack the style and the pedigree
<br/>
And my chances are so few
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd give you all I got
<br/>

<br/>
I never thought that I could be so bold
<br/>
To even say these thoughts aloud
<br/>
But if, let's say, it won't work out
<br/>
You know where I can be found
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd never let you down, I'd never let you down
