<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd never let you down
<br/>

<br/>
It always seems like you're going somewhere
<br/>
Better than you've been before
<br/>
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
<br/>
Of you knocking at my door
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd be all I can be, I'd be all I can be
<br/>

<br/>
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
<br/>
I'm nothing much I know it's true
<br/>
I lack the style and the pedigree
<br/>
And my chances are so few
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd give you all I got
<br/>

<br/>
I never thought that I could be so bold
<br/>
To even say these thoughts aloud
<br/>
But if, let's say, it won't work out
<br/>
You know where I can be found
<br/>

<br/>
That look you give that guy I wanna see
<br/>
Looking right at me
<br/>
If I could be that guy instead of me
<br/>
I'd never let you down, I'd never let you down
