<h3>Nobody</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>D</span>When life seems full of clouds and rain
<br/>
<span>G</span>And I'm full of nothin' but pain
<br/>
<span>A</span>Who soothes my thumpin', bumpin' brain?
<br/>
<span>D</span>Nobody
<br/>

<br/>
When Wintertime comes with its snow and sleet
<br/>
And me with hunger and cold feet
<br/>
Who says ``Here's two bits, go and eat''?
<br/>
Nobody
<br/>

<br/>
<span>A</span>Well,I ain't never done nothin' to 
<br/>
<span>D</span>nobody
<br/>
<span>A</span>I ain't never got nothin' from 
<br/>
<span>D</span>nobody, no time
<br/>
<span>A</span>And until I get something from 
<br/>
<span>D</span>somebody, sometime
<br/>
<span>D</span>I don't intend to <span>G</span>do nothin' for
<br/>
<span>E</span>nobod<span>A</span>y, no t<span>D</span>ime
<br/>

<br/>
When Summertime comes all warm and clear
<br/>
And my friends see me drawin' near
<br/>
Who says ``come on in and have a beer''?
<br/>
Nobody
<br/>

<br/>
Well one time when things was lookin' bright
<br/>
I started to whittlin' on a stick one night
<br/>
Who said ``Hey! That's dynamite!''?
<br/>
Nobody
<br/>

<br/>
Mmmm, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
<br/>
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
<br/>
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
<br/>
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time
<br/>

<br/>
I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
<br/>
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
<br/>
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
<br/>
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time
