<h3>Before my time</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>
I know that hearts were loving
<br/>
Long before I was here
<br/>
And I'm not the first to ever cry
<br/>
In my bed or in my beer
<br/>
There were songs before there was radio
<br/>
Of love that stays and love that goes
<br/>
They were writing meloncholy tunes
<br/>
And tearful words that rhyme
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>

<br/>
There were songs in old dusty books
<br/>
Of love thats always been
<br/>
Sweet lovers in their glory
<br/>
Who are now gone with the wind
<br/>
Old fashion love words spoken then
<br/>
Keep coming back around again
<br/>
Nothings changed except the names
<br/>
Their love burns just like mine
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>

<br/>
And in the dim of yesterday
<br/>
I can clearly see
<br/>
That flesh and blood cried out to someone
<br/>
As it does in me
<br/>
And there was some old song that said
<br/>
I love you 'til I die
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>

<br/>
But what the old time masters had
<br/>
Is what I feel for you
<br/>
Love is love and doesn't change
<br/>
In a century or two
<br/>
If someway they had seen and knew
<br/>
How it would be for me and you
<br/>
They'd wish for love like yours
<br/>
And they would wish for love like mine
<br/>
Before my time
<br/>
Before my time
