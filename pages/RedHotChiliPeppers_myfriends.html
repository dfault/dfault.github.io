<h3>my friends</h3>
<h4>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  My friends are so depressed
<br/>
I feel the question
<br/>
Of your loneliness
<br/>
Confide... 'cause I'll be on your side
<br/>
You know I will, you know I will
<br/>

<br/>
X Girlfriend called me up
<br/>
Alone and desperate
<br/>
On the prison phone
<br/>
They want... to give her 7 years
<br/>
For being sad
<br/>

<br/>
Chorus :
<br/>
I love all of you
<br/>
Hurt by the cold
<br/>
So hard and lonely too
<br/>
When you don't know yourself
<br/>

<br/>
My friends are so distressed
<br/>
And standing on
<br/>
The brink of emptiness
<br/>
No words... I know of to express
<br/>
This emptiness
<br/>

<br/>
Chorus :
<br/>
Imagine me taught by tragedy
<br/>
Release is peace
<br/>
I heard a little girl
<br/>
And what she said
<br/>
Was something beautiful
<br/>
To give... your love
<br/>
No matter what
