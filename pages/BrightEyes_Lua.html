  (Capo 7th fret)
<br/>

<br/>
I <span>G</span>know that it is freezing but I think we have to <span>C</span>walk
<br/>
I keep <span>G</span>waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights <span>G</span>off
<br/>
But <span>Am</span>Julie knows a party at some actor's westside <span>D</span>loft
<br/>
Supplies are <span>C</span>endless in the <span>Am</span>evening, by the <span>C</span>morning <span>D</span>they'll be <span>G</span>gone
<br/>

<br/>
When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend
<br/>
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
<br/>
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
<br/>
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit
<br/>

<br/>
And I <span>C</span>know you have a heavy heart
<br/>
I can <span>G</span>feel it when we kiss
<br/>
So <span>C</span>many men stronger than me
<br/>
have thrown their <span>G</span>backs out trying to <span>A7</span>lift it
<br/>
But <span>C</span>me I'm not a <span>Em</span>gamble, you can <span>G</span>count on <span>D</span>me to <span>C</span>split
<br/>
The love I <span>C</span>sell you in the <span>Am</span>evening, by the <span>C</span>morning <span>D</span>won't <span>G</span>exist
<br/>

<br/>
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
<br/>
Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
<br/>
Well it takes one to know one, kid I think you got it bad
<br/>
What's so easy in the evening, by the morning's such a drag
<br/>

<br/>
I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
<br/>
And if you promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same
<br/>
Well, we might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
<br/>
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
<br/>

<br/>
And I'm <span>C</span>not sure what the trouble was
<br/>
that <span>G</span>started all of this
<br/>
The <span>C</span>reasons all have run away
<br/>
But the <span>G</span>feeling never <span>A7</span>did
<br/>
It's not <span>C</span>something I would <span>Em</span>recommend
<br/>
But it <span>G</span>is one <span>D</span>way to <span>C</span>live
<br/>
Cause what is <span>C</span>simple in the <span>Am</span>moonlight, by the <span>C</span>morning <span>D</span>never <span>G</span>is
<br/>
It was so <span>C</span>simple in the <span>Am</span>moonlight, now it's <span>C</span>so compl<span>D</span>icat<span>Em</span>ed
<br/>
It was so <span>Am</span>simple in the <span>C</span>moonlight
<br/>
So <span>Am</span>simple in the <span>C</span>moonlight
<br/>
So <span>Am</span>simple in the <span>C</span>moonlight
