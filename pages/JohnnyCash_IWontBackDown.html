<br/>

<br/>
Well I <span>F#m</span>won't <span>E</span>back <span>A</span>down, no I <span>F#m</span>won't <span>E</span>back <span>A</span>down
<br/>
You can <span>F#m</span>stand me <span>E</span>up at the <span>D</span>gates of hell
<br/>
But I <span>F#m</span>won't <span>E</span>back <span>A</span>down
<br/>

<br/>
Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
<br/>
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
<br/>
Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down
<br/>

<br/>
<span>D</span>Hey <span>E</span>baby, <span>D</span>there ain't no easy way <span>E</span>out
<br/>
<span>D</span>Hey <span>E</span>I will <span>F#m</span>stand <span>E</span>my <span>A</span>ground and I <span>F#m</span>won't <span>E</span>back <span>E</span>down
<br/>

<br/>
Well I know what's right, I got just one life
<br/>
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
<br/>
But I stand my ground and I won't back down
<br/>

<br/>
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
<br/>
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down
<br/>
No I won't back down.
