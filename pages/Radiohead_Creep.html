<br/>
When you were here before
<br/>
Couldn't look you in the eye
<br/>
You're just like an angel
<br/>
Your skin makes me cry
<br/>

<br/>
You float like a feather
<br/>
In a beautiful world
<br/>
I wish I was special
<br/>
You're so fuckin' special
<br/>

<br/>
But I'm a creep
<br/>
I'm a weirdo
<br/>
What the hell am I doin' here?
<br/>
I don't belong here
<br/>

<br/>
I don't care if it hurts
<br/>
I wanna have control
<br/>
I want a perfect body
<br/>
I want a perfect soul
<br/>

<br/>
I want you to notice
<br/>
When I'm not around
<br/>
You're so fuckin' special
<br/>
I wish I was special
<br/>

<br/>
But I'm a creep
<br/>
I'm a weirdo
<br/>
What the hell am I doin' here?
<br/>
I don't belong here, oh, oh
<br/>

<br/>
She's running out the door
<br/>
She's running out
<br/>
She run, run, run, run
<br/>
Run
<br/>

<br/>
Whatever makes you happy
<br/>
Whatever you want
<br/>
You're so fuckin' special
<br/>
I wish I was special
<br/>

<br/>
But I'm a creep
<br/>
I'm a weirdo
<br/>
What the hell am I doin' here?
<br/>
I don't belong here
<br/>

<br/>
I don't belong here
