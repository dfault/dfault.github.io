<h3>Ring Of Fire</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>Love is a <span>C</span>burning <span>G</span>thing
<br/>
and it <span>G</span>makes a <span>C</span>firery <span>G</span>ring
<br/>
<span>G</span>bound by <span>C</span>wild <span>G</span>desire
<br/>
<span>G</span>I fell in to a <span>C</span>ring of <span>G</span>fire...
<br/>

<br/>
<span>D</span>I fell in to a <span>C</span>burning ring of <span>G</span>fire
<br/>
I went <span>D</span>down,down,down
<br/>
and the <span>C</span>flames went <span>G</span>higher.
<br/>
And it <span>G</span>burns,burns,burns
<br/>
<span>C</span>the ring of <span>G</span>fire
<br/>
<span>D</span>the ring of <span>G</span>fire.
<br/>

<br/>
The taste of love is sweet
<br/>
when hearts like our's meet
<br/>
I fell for you like a child
<br/>
oh, but the fire went wild..
<br/>

<br/>
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
<br/>
I went down,down,down
<br/>
and the flames went higher.
<br/>
And it burns,burns,burns
<br/>
the ring of fire
<br/>
the ring of fire.
