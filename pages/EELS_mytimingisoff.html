<br/>
<span>C</span>My timing is o<span>Em</span>ff
<br/>
S<span>Dm</span>he isn't r<span>Am</span>eady for my l<span>G</span>ove
<br/>
I<span>C</span>t's all that I g<span>Em</span>ot
<br/>
B<span>Dm</span>ut it's a pre<span>Am</span>tty big t<span>G</span>hing
<br/>

<br/>
T<span>F</span>hat she should r<span>C</span>ecognize;
<br/>
The t<span>Am</span>ruth between us cannot h<span>Em</span>ide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>G</span>
<br/>

<br/>
She knows that it's real
<br/>
But the situation doesn't fit
<br/>
I know what I feel
<br/>
And I know that this is really
<br/>

<br/>
Everything it's all about
<br/>
And I don't have a single doubt
<br/>

<br/>
My timing is off
<br/>
But sometimes that's how it all works
<br/>
Believe it or not
<br/>
We don't have a choice
<br/>

<br/>
In matters of the heart;
<br/>
Just gotta be brave enough
<br/>
To love and let yourself be loved
<br/>

<br/>
My timing is off
<br/>
And I'm not worried 'bout a thing
<br/>
She knows that it's real
<br/>
She couldn't throw it all away
<br/>

<br/>
For fear of happiness
<br/>
This isn't like that other mess
