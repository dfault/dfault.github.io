<br/>
She knows that it's real
<br/>
But the situation doesn't fit
<br/>
I know what I feel
<br/>
And I know that this is really
<br/>

<br/>
Everything it's all about
<br/>
And I don't have a single doubt
<br/>

<br/>
My timing is off
<br/>
But sometimes that's how it all works
<br/>
Believe it or not
<br/>
We don't have a choice
<br/>

<br/>
In matters of the heart;
<br/>
Just gotta be brave enough
<br/>
To love and let yourself be loved
<br/>

<br/>
My timing is off
<br/>
And I'm not worried 'bout a thing
<br/>
She knows that it's real
<br/>
She couldn't throw it all away
<br/>

<br/>
For fear of happiness
<br/>
This isn't like that other mess
