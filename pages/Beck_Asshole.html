  Your brains went black when she took back her love 
<br/>
and put it out into the sun 
<br/>
The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry 
<br/>
And the cigarettes are smokin by themselves 
<br/>

<br/>
S<span class="chord">A</span>he'll do anyth<span class="chord">C</span>ing to make you feel like an asshole 
<br/>

<br/>
Call her name, she looks the same as you 
<br/>
question mark stretched across the skin 
<br/>
She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarrassed 
<br/>
to be the fool you know you are
