<br/>
<span>D</span>Hello, I've <span>Bm</span>waited here for you... <span>G</span>Ev<span>Bm</span>erlong.
<br/>
<span>D</span>Tonight, I <span>Bm</span>throw myself into,
<br/>
<span>G</span>And out of the <span>Bm</span>red, out of her head she sang.
<br/>

<br/>
Come down and waste away with me, down with me...
<br/>
Slow how, you wanted it to be,
<br/>
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang.
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Db</span> $\;$ <span>D</span> $\;$ <span>E</span> $\;$ <span>A</span>And I wonder <span>Db</span> $\;$ <span>D</span> $\;$ <span>E</span> $\;$ <span>A</span> when I sing along with you, <span>Db</span> $\;$ <span>D</span> $\;$ <span>E</span> $\;$
<br/>
<span>Bm</span>If everything could ever <span>G</span>feel this real <span>D</span>forever.
<br/>
<span>Bm</span>If anything could ever <span>G</span>be this good <span>D</span>again,
<br/>
<span>Bm</span>The only thing I'll ever <span>G</span>ask of you.
<br/>
<span>D</span>You gotta promise not to <span>A</span>stop when I <span>G</span>say when.
<br/>
She sang:
<br/>

<br/>
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in,
<br/>
Hold you in, and now, I know you've always been there
<br/>
Out of your head, out of my head I sang.
<br/>

<br/>
And I wonder when I sing along with you,
<br/>
If everything could ever feel this real forever,
<br/>
If anything could ever be this good again.
<br/>
The only thing I'll ever ask of you,
<br/>
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
<br/>
She sang:
<br/>

<br/>
And I wonder...
<br/>
If everything could ever feel this real forever,
<br/>
If anything could ever be this good again.
<br/>
The only thing I'll ever ask of you,
<br/>
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
