<h3>Far From Home</h3>
<h4>Levellers</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  I<span>C</span>t's warm by the river, the weir keeps us clean
<br/>
The w<span>F4</span>oodsmoke and cigarettes are all that we n<span>C</span>eed
<br/>
M<span>C</span>arking the dirt with twigs and simple words spoke
<br/>
Kick<span>F4</span>ing the dust so we can just..
<br/>

<br/>
D<span>C</span>ance the dance that plays with fire
<br/>
We pl<span>Bb</span>ay guitar and we play it insp<span>C</span>ired
<br/>
Y<span>C</span>ou said you would leave not ever
<br/>
U<span>Bb</span>nderneath the sky for<span>C</span>ever
<br/>

<br/>
			    
<br/>
It's cool by the sea when the pavement is hot
<br/>
We take a walk down there to see what we've got
<br/>
An old man collecting fifty beautiful words
<br/>
Cleaning the beach so he can teach us to
<br/>
			        
<br/>

<br/>
CHORUS
<br/>

<br/>
It's cold by the pane glass on the high street we played
<br/>
But there's always a penny in the music we made
<br/>
So far from home with no means of return
<br/>
Burning bridges, so we always
<br/>

<br/>
CHORUS
<br/>

<br/>
W<span>G</span>e're so far from home
<br/>
No ne<span>Dm</span>ed to return
<br/>
Th<span>Bb</span>ere's so much that we have taught 
<br/>
And s<span>C</span>o much that we have learned 
<br/>
