<br/>

<br/>
Sad but true, sad but true
<br/>
You’re telling me what to do
<br/>
I’ve learned my lesson, that stupid question
<br/>
Now it hurts my pride
<br/>
And you’re a girl, a serious girl
<br/>
Showing me the world
<br/>
Oh my love, you’re so tired
<br/>
But you must think quiet
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna love you but i’m growing old
<br/>
Ten little soldiers screaming in my soul.
<br/>
Will she come over when it’s time to go,
<br/>
come on and show me little
<br/>
drummerboy, no
<br/>
Mr Moon, Mr Moon, Mr Moon.
<br/>
Hey, hey, heeey…..
<br/>
Mr Moon, Mr Moon, Mr Moon.
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna love you but i’m growing old
<br/>
Ten little soldiers screaming in my soul.
<br/>
Will she come over when it’s time to go, come on and show me little
<br/>
drummerboy.
<br/>

<br/>
I wanna love you but i’m growing old
<br/>
Ten little soldiers screaming in my soul.
<br/>
The day is using up it's final breath
<br/>
I've never been so sure I've never doubted you,
<br/>
Mr Moon, Mr Moon, Mr Moon
