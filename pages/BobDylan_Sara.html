I <span class="chord">Em</span>laid on a dune  
<br/>
<br/>
I <span class="chord">Am</span>looked at the sky  
<br/>
<br/>
When the <span class="chord">D</span>children were babies  
<br/>
<br/>
And <span class="chord">Em</span>played on the beach
<br/>
You came up to behind me  
<br/>
<br/>
I s<span class="chord">Am</span>aw you go by   
<br/>
<br/>
You were <span class="chord">D</span>always so close  
<br/>
<br/>
and st<span class="chord">Em</span>ill within' reach
<br/>

So <span class="chord">D</span>easy to look at, so h<span class="chord">C</span>ard to def<span class="chord">Em</span>ine.

<br/>
I can syill see them playin'
<br/>
With their pails in the sand
<br/>
They run to the water
<br/>
Their buckets to fill
<br/>
I can still see the shells
<br/>
Fallin' out of their hands
<br/>
As they follow each other
<br/>
Back up the hill
<br/>
Sara, Sara
<br/>
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
<br/>
Sara, Sara
<br/>
Radiant jewel, mystical wife
<br/>

<br/>
Sleepin' in the woods
<br/>
By a fire in the night
<br/>
Drinkin' white rum
<br/>
In a Portugal bar
<br/>
Them playin' leap-frog
<br/>
And hearin' about Snow White
<br/>
You in the market place
<br/>
In Savanna-la-Mar
<br/>
Sara, Sara
<br/>
It's all so clear, I could never forget
<br/>
Sara, Sara
<br/>
Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret
<br/>

<br/>
I can still hear the sounds
<br/>
Of those Methodist bells
<br/>
I'd taken the cure
<br/>
And had just gotten through
<br/>
Stayin' up for days
<br/>
In the Chelsea Hotel
<br/>
Writin' ``Sad-Eyed Lady
<br/>
Of the Lowlands'' for you
<br/>
Sara, Sara
<br/>
Wherever we travel we're never apart
<br/>
Sara, oh Sara
<br/>
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart
<br/>

<br/>
How did I meet you
<br/>
I don't know
<br/>
A messenger sent me
<br/>
In a tropical storm
<br/>
You were there in the winter
<br/>
Moonlight on the snow
<br/>
And on Lily Pond Lane
<br/>
When the weather was warm
<br/>
Sara, oh Sara
<br/>
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
<br/>
Sara, Sara
<br/>
You must forgive me my unworthiness
<br/>

<br/>
Now the beach is deserted
<br/>
Except for some kelp
<br/>
And a peice of an old ship
<br/>
That lies on the shore
<br/>
You always responded
<br/>
When I needed your help
<br/>
You gimme a map
<br/>
And a key to your door
<br/>
Sara, oh Sara
<br/>
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
<br/>
Sara, oh Sara
<br/>
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go
