<br/>
Yeah its always better when we're together.
<br/>

<br/>
and all of these moments just might find their way into my<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp dreams tonight 
<br/>
but I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp or brings new things 
<br/>
for tomorrow night you'll see that they'll be gone too too<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp many things I have to do.
<br/>
 but if all of these dreams might find their way into my day<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp to day scene 
<br/>
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere inbetween with<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp only 2 just me and you 
<br/>
now so many things we got to do, or places we got to be<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah its always better when we're always together 
<br/>
mmmm we're somewhere in between together 
<br/>
well its always better when we're together 
<br/>
Yeah it's always better when we're together :
<br/>

<br/>
mmmm mmm mmmm
