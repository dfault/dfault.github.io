<h3>Better Together</h3>
<h4>Jack Johnson</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  T<span>D</span>here's no combin<span>Dmj7</span>ation of words that I could <span>Bm</span>put on the back of a p<span>A</span>ostcard
<br/>
N<span>G</span>o song that <span>D/F#</span>I could sing but <span>Em</span>I can try for <span>A</span>your heart and
<br/>
O<span>D</span>ur dr<span>Dmaj7</span>eams and they are <span>Bm</span>made out of real th<span>A</span>ings like
<br/>
a<span>G</span> shoebox of ph<span>D/F#</span>otographs and s<span>Em</span>epia-toned lo<span>A</span>vin
<br/>
L<span>D</span>ove is the a<span>Dmaj7</span>nswer at least for m<span>Bm</span>ost of the questions in m<span>A</span>y heart like
<br/>
w<span>G</span>hy are we here a<span>D/F#</span>nd where do we go a<span>Em</span>nd how come its s<span>A</span>o hard? 
<br/>
I<span>D</span>ts not always e<span>Dmaj7</span>asy and sometimes l<span>Bm</span>ife can be dec<span>A</span>ieving
<br/>
I<span>G</span>'ll tell you <span>D/F#</span>one thing it's always b<span>Em</span>etter when we're t<span>A</span>ogethe<span>Ab</span>r 
<br/>
m<span>G</span>mmmm its always b<span>A</span>etter when we're togeth<span>Ab</span>e<span>G</span>r
<br/>
Yeah well look at them s<span>A</span>tars when we're togeth<span>Ab</span>e<span>G</span>r 
<br/>
Well it's always b<span>A</span>etter when we're togeth<span>Ab</span>e<span>G</span>r
<br/>
Yeah its always better when we're together.
<br/>

<br/>
and all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight 
<br/>
but I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings or brings new things 
<br/>
for tomorrow night you'll see that they'll be gone too too many things I have to do.
<br/>
 but if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene 
<br/>
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere inbetween with only 2 just me and you 
<br/>
now so many things we got to do, or places we got to be we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah its always better when we're always together 
<br/>
mmmm we're somewhere in between together 
<br/>
well its always better when we're together 
<br/>
Yeah it's always better when we're together :
<br/>

<br/>
mmmm mmm mmmm
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>I believe in me<span>A</span>mories they look so, <span>G</span>so pretty when I s<span>A</span>leep, hey now and
<br/>
a<span>G</span>nd when I w<span>A</span>ake up you look so pr<span>G</span>etty sleeping next to a<span>A</span>me but there is 
<br/>
n<span>G</span>ot enough t<span>A</span>ime. there is no, <span>G</span>no song I could s<span>A</span>ing and there is no 
<br/>
c<span>G</span>ombination of w<span>A</span>ords I could say but I will st<span>G</span>ill tell you one th<span>A</span>ing we're better together
