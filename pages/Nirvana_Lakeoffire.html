<span class="chord">Dm</span>I knew a lady who <span class="chord">H</span>came from Duluth

<span class="chord">Dm</span>Bitten by a dog with a <span class="chord">A</span>rabid tooth

<br/>
Where do bad folks go when they die
<br/>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
<br/>
Go to a lake of fire and fry
<br/>
see them again 'till the Fourth of July
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
People cry and people moan
<br/>
Look for a dry place to call their home
<br/>
Try to find some place to rest their bones
<br/>
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own
<br/>

<br/>
Where do bad folks go when they die
<br/>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
<br/>
Go to a lake of fire and fry
<br/>
see them again 'till the Fourth of July
<br/>
