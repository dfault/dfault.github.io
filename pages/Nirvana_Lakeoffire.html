<h3>Lake of fire</h3>
<h4>Nirvana</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>G</span>Where do bad folks <span>F</span>go when they <span>H</span>die
<br/>
<span>G</span>They don't go to heaven where the <span>C</span>angels <span>H</span>fly
<br/>
<span>G</span>Go to a lake of <span>F</span>fire and <span>H</span>fry
<br/>
<span>C</span>see them again 't<span>F</span>ill the Fourth of <span>G</span>July
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>Dm</span>I knew a lady who <span>H</span>came from Duluth
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>Bitten by a dog with a <span>A</span>rabid tooth
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>She went to her grave just a <span>H</span>little too soon
<br/>
<span>C</span>Flew and lay down on the <span>Dm</span>yellow moon
<br/>

<br/>
Where do bad folks go when they die
<br/>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
<br/>
Go to a lake of fire and fry
<br/>
see them again 'till the Fourth of July
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
People cry and people moan
<br/>
Look for a dry place to call their home
<br/>
Try to find some place to rest their bones
<br/>
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own
<br/>

<br/>
Where do bad folks go when they die
<br/>
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
<br/>
Go to a lake of fire and fry
<br/>
see them again 'till the Fourth of July
<br/>
