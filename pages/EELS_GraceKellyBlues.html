<h3>Grace Kelly Blues</h3>
<h4>EELS</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  (Capo 5th fret)
<br/>

<br/>
The <span>C</span>cut-rate <span>Am</span>mime walking <span>F</span>through the dirty <span>G</span>streets
<br/>
Of <span>C</span>paris <span>Am</span>in the <span>F</span>hot august <span>G</span>heat
<br/>
<span>F</span>Sun melting the <span>G</span>fake <span>Em</span>smile <span>F</span>away
<br/>
<span>F</span>Just looking <span>G</span>for a place to <span>C</span>stay
<br/>

<br/>
The actress gave up all her old dreams
<br/>
And traded up now she is a queen
<br/>
Royal families don't have time for that shit
<br/>
Your crystal ball - you keep it hid
<br/>

<br/>
The tractor-trailer driver radios:
<br/>
Help me someone i'm out here all alone
<br/>
Truck driving the black night away
<br/>
Praying for the light of day
<br/>

<br/>
The kid in the mall works at hawt dawg on a stick
<br/>
His hat is a funny shape his heart is a brick
<br/>
Taking your order he will look away
<br/>
He doesn't have a thing to say
<br/>

<br/>
But me i'm feeling pretty good as of now
<br/>
I'm not so sure when i got here or how
<br/>
Sun melting the fake smile away
<br/>
I think, you know, i'll be okay
<br/>
