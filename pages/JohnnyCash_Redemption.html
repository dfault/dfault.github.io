<h3>Redemption</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>

<br/>
From the <span>Am</span>hands it came down
<br/>
From the <span>Dm</span>side it came down
<br/>
From the <span>E</span>feet it came down
<br/>
And <span>Am</span>ran to the ground
<br/>
Between <span>Am</span>heaven and hell
<br/>
A <span>Dm</span>teardrop fell
<br/>
In the <span>E</span>deep crimson dew
<br/>
The <span>Am</span>tree of life grew
<br/>

<br/>
And the <span>C</span>blood gave life
<br/>
To the <span>G</span>branches of the tree
<br/>
And the <span>F</span>blood was the price
<br/>
That <span>G</span>set the captives free
<br/>
And the <span>C</span>numbers that came
<br/>
Through the <span>G</span>fire and the flood 
<br/>
<span>F</span>Clung to the tree
<br/>
And were red<span>Am</span>eemed by the blood
<br/>

<br/>
From the tree streamed a light
<br/>
That started the fight
<br/>
'Round the tree grew a vine
<br/>
On whose fruit I could dine
<br/>
My old friend Lucifer came
<br/>
Fought to keep me in chains
<br/>
But I saw through the tricks
<br/>
Of six-sixty-six
<br/>

<br/>
And the blood gave life
<br/>
To the branches of the tree
<br/>
And the blood was the price
<br/>
That set the captives free
<br/>
And the numbers that came
<br/>
Through the fire and the flood 
<br/>
Clung to the tree
<br/>
And were redeemed by the blood
<br/>

<br/>
From his hands it came down
<br/>
From his side it came down
<br/>
From his feet it came down
<br/>
And ran to the ground
<br/>
And a small inner voice
<br/>
Said You do have a choice
<br/>
The vine engrafted me
<br/>
And I clung to the tree
