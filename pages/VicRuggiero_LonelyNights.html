<br/>
Do you remember all those lonely nights together
<br/>
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
<br/>
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
<br/>
Honey, I remember every one
<br/>

<br/>
Remember when you threw my clothes out the window
<br/>
You know it's pretty clear that way
<br/>
To see which way the wind blows
<br/>
Remember how I left the light on
<br/>
You didn't like that very much
<br/>
You really put the bite on
<br/>

<br/>
Do you remember all those lonely nights together
<br/>
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
<br/>
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
<br/>
Honey, I remember every one
<br/>

<br/>
And you remember that time that,
<br/>
Well, I don't have to go into that. That time...
<br/>
The other time, when I was comin' home and you were...
<br/>
Well I know you couldn't forget, the time I said...
<br/>
I know, we can laugh about that now...
