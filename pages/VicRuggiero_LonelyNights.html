<br/>
Do you rem<span>A</span>ember all those l<span>C#</span>onely nights toegeth<span>F#</span>er

<br/>
Verse:
<br/>
&nbsp;<span>C#</span>   Remember driving home from the p<span>F#</span>ark
<br/>
&nbsp;<span>B</span>  You yelled at me about my porno mags
<br/>
&nbsp;<span>E</span>  In front of my sister
<br/>
&nbsp;<span>C#</span>   Remeber all those nights we h<span>F#</span>ad such a ball
<br/>
&nbsp;<span>B</span>  Putting my fist through the wall can
<br/>
&nbsp;<span>E</span>  Make such a bl<span>E7</span>ister... <span>E6</span>Ahhh<span>E</span>h...
<br/>

<br/>
Do you remember all those lonely nights together
<br/>
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
<br/>
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
<br/>
Honey, I remember every one
<br/>

<br/>
Remember when you threw my clothes out the window
<br/>
You know it's pretty clear that way
<br/>
To see which way the wind blows
<br/>
Remember how I left the light on
<br/>
You didn't like that very much
<br/>
You really put the bite on
<br/>

<br/>
Do you remember all those lonely nights together
<br/>
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
<br/>
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
<br/>
Honey, I remember every one
<br/>

<br/>
And you remember that time that,
<br/>
Well, I don't have to go into that. That time...
<br/>
The other time, when I was comin' home and you were...
<br/>
Well I know you couldn't forget, the time I said...
<br/>
I know, we can laugh about that now...
