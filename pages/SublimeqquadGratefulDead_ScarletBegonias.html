<h3>Scarlet Begonias</h3>
<h4>Sublime\qquad(Grateful Dead)</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>E</span>As I was walkin down rubadub squ<span>B</span>are 
<br/>
<span>E</span>Not a chill to the window a little to the <span>B</span>air 
<br/>
<span>A</span>From another <span>E</span>direction <span>A</span>she was caught in my e<span>E</span>ye
<br/>
<span>A</span>It could be an <span>E</span>illusion, but <span>A</span>I might as well <span>E</span>try
<br/>
..might as well <span>B</span>try
<br/>

<br/>
<span>E</span>She had rings on her fingers and bells on her sh<span>B</span>oes 
<br/>
<span>E</span>And I could tell without asking she was into the bl<span>B</span>ues 
<br/>
<span>A</span>She wore sc<span>E</span>arlet begonias t<span>A</span>ucked into her c<span>E</span>urls
<br/>
<span>A</span>I knew right <span>E</span>away she was <span>A</span>not like other g<span>E</span>irls
<br/>
..other gir<span>B</span>ls
<br/>

<br/>
Well <span>F#</span>I ain't never been right as I ain't never been wrong
<br/>
As <span>B</span>everthing works out the <span>E</span>way it <span>A</span>does in this <span>E</span>song
<br/>
<span>F#</span>Cause once in a while you get shown in the light
<br/>
In the st<span>B</span>rangest of places <span>E</span>if you <span>A</span>look at it <span>E</span>right

<br/>
It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above
<br/>
Because the women took the lovin over me
<br/>
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus
<br/>
Because I sold off my personal property
<br/>
A tie-dyed dress , she was a psychadelic mess
<br/>
We toured to the north, south, east and west
<br/>
We sold some mushroom tea,
<br/>
Sold some ectacy,
<br/>
Sold nitrus, opium, acid, herion and PCP
<br/>
Now I hear the police coming after me
<br/>
Now I hear the police coming after me
<br/>
The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair,
<br/>
She's got the police coming after me
<br/>

<br/>
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
<br/>
All scarlet begoinas and a touch of the blues
<br/>
And there ain't nothin wrong with the love that's in her eyes
<br/>
I had to learn the hard way just to let her  pass by.
