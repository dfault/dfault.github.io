<h3>Black</h3>
<h4>Bonnie Prince Billy</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>Black, you are my <span class="chord">D</span>enemy
<br/>
<br/>
And <span class="chord">Bm</span>I cannot get <span class="chord">Em</span>close to thee
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>Our life is ruled by <span class="chord">D</span>enmity
<br/>
<br/>
And <span class="chord">Bm</span>I can't weaken <span class="chord">Em</span>that
<br/>
<br/>
The <span class="chord">Em</span>only way that <span class="chord">D</span>I can see
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Bm</span>Is to hold you <span class="chord">Em</span>close to me
<br/>
<br/>
To <span class="chord">Em</span>love you for it's <span class="chord">D</span>meant to be
<br/>
<br/>
I <span class="chord">Bm</span>weaken your <span class="chord">Em</span>attack
<br/>

<br/>
Everything was lucked and downy
<br/>
What was good was up from under
<br/>
Until black, that awful tender
<br/>
Came and popped my sense of wonder
<br/>
All at once all eyes turned at him
<br/>
Leaving me an unwatched body
<br/>
And it sagged, my body's rib cage
<br/>
Out from under ogler's study
<br/>
Black was decomposing quickly
<br/>
This was found offensive to me
<br/>
His disrespect for life's proprieties
<br/>
Made me scared he would destroy me
<br/>

<br/>
Black, you are my enemy
<br/>
And I cannot get close to thee
<br/>
Our life is ruled by enmity
<br/>
And I can't weaken that
<br/>
The only way that I can see
<br/>
Is to hold you close to me
<br/>
To love you for it's meant to be
<br/>
I weaken your attack
<br/>

<br/>
So I thought I'd try to cut him
<br/>
Try to force him 'neath my level
<br/>
The only way to equal to him
<br/>
Would be hit him with a shovel
<br/>
But to really rise above him
<br/>
That would be the final evil
<br/>
So instead I asked the sucker
<br/>
If he'd care to see my rooms
<br/>
And as a friend and as a comrade
<br/>
And all the things that these implied
<br/>
I made him leave what it was that he had
<br/>
Used to keep us unallied
<br/>

<br/>
Black, you are my enemy
<br/>
And I cannot get close to thee
<br/>
Our life is ruled by enmity
<br/>
And I can't weaken that
<br/>
The only way that I can see
<br/>
Is to hold you close to me
<br/>
To love you for it's meant to be
<br/>
I weaken your attack
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>Now black and I we <span class="chord">Bm</span>are together
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>Fairly just ins<span class="chord">Bm</span>eparable
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>And in the terribl<span class="chord">Bm</span>est of weather
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F#m</span>Our bonds are incorruptible
<br/>

<br/>
Black, you are my enemy
<br/>
And I cannot get close to thee
<br/>
Our life is ruled by enmity
<br/>
And I can't weaken that
<br/>
The only way that I can see
<br/>
Is to hold you close to me
<br/>
To love you for it's meant to be
<br/>
I weaken your attack
<br/>
