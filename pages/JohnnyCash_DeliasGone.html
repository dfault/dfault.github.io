<h3>Delia's Gone</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>A</span>Delia, oh, <span>D</span>Delia <span>A</span>Delia all my <span>A7</span>life
<br/>
If <span>D</span>I hadn't have shot poor
<br/>
Delia I'd <span>B7</span>have had her for my <span>E7</span>wife
<br/>
Delia's <span>A</span>gone, <span>D</span>one more <span>A</span>round <span>E7</span>Delia's <span>A</span>gone
<br/>

<br/>
I went up to Memphis
<br/>
And I met Delia there
<br/>
Found her in her parlor
<br/>
And I tied to her chair
<br/>
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
<br/>

<br/>
She was low down and trifling
<br/>
And she was cold and mean
<br/>
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
<br/>
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
<br/>

<br/>
First time I shot her I shot her in the side
<br/>
Hard to watch her suffer
<br/>
But with the second shot she died
<br/>
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
<br/>

<br/>
But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer,
<br/>
I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside
<br/>
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
<br/>
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
<br/>

<br/>
So if you woman's devilish
<br/>
You can let her run
<br/>
Or you can bring her down and do her
<br/>
Like Delia got done
<br/>
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
<br/>
