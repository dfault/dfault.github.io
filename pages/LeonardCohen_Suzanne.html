<h3>Suzanne</h3>
<h4>Leonard Cohen</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
<span class="chord">E</span>Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
<br/>
<br/>
You can <span class="chord">F#m</span>hear the boats go by
<br/>
You can spend the night beside her
<br/>
<br/>
And you <span class="chord">E</span>know that she's half crazy
<br/>
But that's why you want to be there
<br/>
<br/>
And she <span class="chord">G#m</span>feeds you tea and oranges
<br/>
<br/>
That come <span class="chord">A</span>all the way from China
<br/>
<br/>
And just <span class="chord">E</span>when you mean to tell her
<br/>
<br/>
That you <span class="chord">F#m</span>have no love to give her
<br/>
<br/>
Then she <span class="chord">E</span>gets you on her wavelength
<br/>
<br/>
And she <span class="chord">F#m</span>lets the river answer
<br/>
<br/>
That you've <span class="chord">E</span>always been her lover
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And you <span class="chord">G#m</span>want to travel with her
<br/>
<br/>
And you <span class="chord">A</span>want to travel blind
<br/>
<br/>
And you <span class="chord">E</span>know that she will trust you
<br/>
<br/>
For you've <span class="chord">F#m</span>touched her perfect body with your <span class="chord">E</span>mind.
<br/>

<br/>
And Jesus was a sailor
<br/>
When he walked upon the water
<br/>
And he spent a long time watching
<br/>
From his lonely wooden tower
<br/>
And when he knew for certain
<br/>
Only drowning men could see him
<br/>
He said, All men will be sailors then
<br/>
Until the sea shall free them,
<br/>
But he himself was broken
<br/>
Long before the sky would open
<br/>
Forsaken, almost human
<br/>
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
<br/>

<br/>
And you want to travel with him
<br/>
And you want to travel blind
<br/>
And you think maybe you'll trust him
<br/>
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.
<br/>

<br/>
Now Suzanne takes your hand
<br/>
And she leads you to the river
<br/>
She is wearing rags and feathers
<br/>
From Salvation Army counters
<br/>
And the sun pours down like honey
<br/>
On our lady of the harbour
<br/>
And she shows you where to look
<br/>
Among the garbage and the flowers
<br/>
There are heroes in the seaweed
<br/>
There are children in the morning
<br/>
They are leaning out for love
<br/>
And they will lean that way forever
<br/>
While Suzanne holds the mirror
<br/>

<br/>
And you want to travel with her
<br/>
And you want to travel blind
<br/>
And you know that you can trust her
<br/>
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.
