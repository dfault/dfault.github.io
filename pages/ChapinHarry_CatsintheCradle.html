<h3>Cat's in the Cradle</h3>
<h4>Chapin Harry</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  M<span>A</span>y child arrived just the <span>C</span>other day;
<br/>
he <span>D</span>came into the world in the <span>A</span>usual way.
<br/>
But there were <span>A</span>planes to catch, and <span>C</span>bills to pay.
<br/>
H<span>D</span>e learned to walk while I <span>A</span>was away.
<br/>
And he was <span>G</span>talkin' 'fore I <span>G/F#</span>knew it.  And <span>Em7</span>as he gr<span>Em/D</span>ew
<br/>
he'd say, ''<span>C</span>I'm gonna <span>Em/B</span>be like <span>A</span>you, Dad.  You <span>C</span>know I'm gonna <span>Em/B</span>be like <span>A</span>you.''
<br/>

<br/>
And the c<span>A</span>at's in the cradle and the s<span>G</span>ilver spoon,
<br/>
<span>C</span>little boy blue and the <span>D</span>man in the moon.
<br/>
<span>A</span>''When you comin' home Dad?''  ''I <span>G</span>don't know when,
<br/>
but w<span>C</span>e'll get tog<span>Em/B</span>ether the<span>A</span>n, Son.  You <span>C</span>know we'll have a <span>Em/B</span>good time <span>A</span>then.''
<br/>

<br/>
My <span>A</span>son turned ten just the <span>C</span>other day.
<br/>
He said, ''<span>D</span>Thanks for the ball, Dad.  Come <span>A</span>on, let's play.
<br/>
Can you <span>A</span>teach me to throw?''  I said, ''<span>C</span>Not today.
<br/>
I got a <span>D</span>lot to do.''  He said, ''T<span>A</span>hat's okay.''
<br/>
And he <span>G</span>walked a<span>G/F#</span>way, but his s<span>Em7</span>mile never d<span>Em/D</span>immed.
<br/>
It said, ''<span>C</span>I'm gonna b<span>Em/B</span>e like <span>A</span>him, yeah.  You <span>C</span>know I'm gonna <span>Em/B</span>be like <span>A</span>him.''
<br/>

<br/>
And the c<span>A</span>at's in the cradle and the s<span>G</span>ilver spoon,
<br/>
<span>C</span>little boy blue and the <span>D</span>man in the moon.
<br/>
<span>A</span>''When you comin' home Dad?''  ''I <span>G</span>don't know when,
<br/>
but w<span>C</span>e'll get tog<span>Em/B</span>ether the<span>A</span>n, Son.  You <span>C</span>know we'll have a <span>Em/B</span>good time <span>A</span>then.''
<br/>

<br/>
Well, he <span>A</span>came home from college just the <span>C</span>other day,
<br/>
so <span>D</span>much like a man I just <span>A</span>had to say,
<br/>
''Son, I'm <span>A</span>proud of you.  Can you <span>C</span>sit for a while?''
<br/>
He <span>D</span>shook his head and he <span>A</span>said with a smile,
<br/>
''What I'd <span>G</span>really like, <span>G/F#</span>Dad, is to <span>Em7</span>borrow the car <span>Em/D</span>keys.
<br/>
<span>C</span>See you <span>Em/B</span>later.  Can I <span>A</span>have them please?''
<br/>

<br/>
And the c<span>A</span>at's in the cradle and the s<span>G</span>ilver spoon,
<br/>
<span>C</span>little boy blue and the <span>D</span>man in the moon.
<br/>
<span>A</span>''When you comin' home Son?''  ''I <span>G</span>don't know when,
<br/>
but w<span>C</span>e'll get tog<span>Em/B</span>ether the<span>A</span>n, Dad.  You <span>C</span>know we'll have a <span>Em/B</span>good time <span>A</span>then.''
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I've <span>A</span>long since retired, my <span>C</span>son's moved away.
<br/>
<span>D</span>I called him up just the <span>A</span>other day.
<br/>
I said, ''I'd <span>A</span>like to see you if <span>C</span>you don't mind.''
<br/>
He said, ''I'd <span>D</span>love to, Dad, if I could <span>A</span>find the time.
<br/>
You see, my <span>G</span>new job's a <span>G/F#</span>hassle and the <span>Em7</span>kids have the f<span>Em/D</span>lu,
<br/>
but it's <span>C</span>sure nice <span>Em/B</span>talkin' to <span>A</span>you, Dad.  It's been <span>C</span>sure nice <span>Em/B</span>talkin' to <span>A</span>you.''
<br/>
And as I <span>G</span>hung up the <span>G/F#</span>phone it <span>Em7</span>occured to m<span>Em/D</span>e,
<br/>
he'd <span>C</span>grown up <span>Em/B</span>just like <span>A</span>me.    My <span>C</span>boy was <span>Em/B</span>just like <span>A</span>me.
<br/>

<br/>
And the c<span>A</span>at's in the cradle and the s<span>G</span>ilver spoon,
<br/>
<span>C</span>little boy blue and the <span>D</span>man in the moon.
<br/>
<span>A</span>''When you comin' home Son?''  ''I <span>G</span>don't know when,
<br/>
but <span>C</span>we'll get tog<span>Em/B</span>ether the<span>A</span>n, Dad, we're <span>C</span>gonna have a <span>Em/B</span>good time <span>A</span>then.''
