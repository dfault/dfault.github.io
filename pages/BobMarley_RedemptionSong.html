<br/>

<br/>
Old <span>G</span>pirates, yes, they <span>Em</span>rob i;
<br/>
Sold <span>C</span>I to the merchant <span>Am</span>ships,
<br/>
<span>G</span>Minutes after they <span>Em</span>took i
<br/>
<span>C</span>From the <span>G</span>bottom<span>D</span>less pit.
<br/>
But my <span>G</span>hand was <span>Em</span>made strong
<br/>
<span>C</span>By the hand of the al<span>Am</span>mighty.
<br/>
We <span>G</span>forward in this gene<span>Em</span>ration
<br/>
<span>C</span>Triu<span>G</span>mphantl<span>D</span>y.
<br/>
Wont you help to <span>G</span>sing
<br/>
<span>C</span>These <span>D</span>songs of <span>G</span>freedom? -
<br/>
cause <span>C</span>all I <span>D</span>ever <span>Em</span>have:
<br/>
<span>C</span>Rede<span>D</span>mption <span>G</span>songs;
<br/>
<span>C</span>Rede<span>D</span>mption <span>G</span>songs.
<br/>

<br/>
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
<br/>
None but ourselves can free our minds.
<br/>
Have no fear for atomic energy,
<br/>
cause none of them can stop the time.
<br/>
How long shall they kill our prophets,
<br/>
While we stand aside and look? ooh!
<br/>
Some say its just a part of it:
<br/>
Weve got to fulfil de book.
<br/>

<br/>
Wont you help to sing
<br/>
These songs of freedom? -
<br/>
cause all I ever have:
<br/>
Redemption songs;
<br/>
Redemption songs;
<br/>
Redemption songs.
