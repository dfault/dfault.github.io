<h3>Horses</h3>
<h4>Bonnie Prince Billy</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  (Capo 3rd fret)
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">D</span>I'd be riding horses if they'd <span class="chord">C</span>let me
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>Sleep outside at night and not take <span class="chord">D</span>fright
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">D</span>I would ride the range and never <span class="chord">C</span>worry
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">Em</span>I would disappear into the <span class="chord">D</span>night
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Every<span class="chord">Em</span>body needs an <span class="chord">D</span>angel
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>But here's that <span class="chord">Em</span>devil by my <span class="chord">D</span>side
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>A death's head <span class="chord">Em</span>ring upon his <span class="chord">D</span>finger
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Poor boy <span class="chord">Em</span>hanging on the <span class="chord">D</span>light
<br/>

<br/>
They'll be drawing straws inside the courtroom
<br/>
As the sudden twilight turns to black
<br/>
And torches burn into the sad eyes
<br/>
On the wrong side of the track
<br/>

<br/>
Make those horses jump through hoops of flame
<br/>
They won't kick and they won't scream
<br/>
Let the good Lord do the driving
<br/>
While poor boy sinks in the stream
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I can smell the campfires burning
<br/>
But I'll go out walking on my own
<br/>
By day and night the world keeps turning
<br/>
Frightened people hiding in their homes
<br/>

<br/>
Everybody needs his angel
<br/>
But here's that devil by my side
<br/>
A death's head ring upon his finger
<br/>
Poor boy hanging on the light
<br/>
And everybody needs an angel
<br/>
But here's that devil by my side
<br/>
A death's head ring upon his finger
<br/>
Poor boy hanging on the light
