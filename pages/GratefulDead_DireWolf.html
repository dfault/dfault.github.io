<h3>Dire Wolf</h3>
<h4>Grateful Dead</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <br/>
In the t<span class="chord">G</span>imbers of Fennario,
<br/>
<br/>
The w<span class="chord">Bb</span>olves are running r<span class="chord">F</span>ound,
<br/>
<br/>
The w<span class="chord">F</span>inter was so hard and cold,
<br/>
<br/>
Froze ten feet 'neath the gr<span class="chord">G</span>ound.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't murder <span class="chord">F</span>m<span class="chord">G</span>e,
<br/>
<br/>
I beg of y<span class="chord">C</span>ou, don't m<span class="chord">Bb</span>urder m<span class="chord">F</span>e.
<br/>
<br/>
Ple<span class="chord">G</span>as<span class="chord">F</span>e, don't murder m<span class="chord">C</span>e.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I s<span class="chord">G</span>at down to my supper,
<br/>
<br/>
'Tw<span class="chord">Bb</span>as a bottle of red whisk<span class="chord">F</span>y,
<br/>
<br/>
I s<span class="chord">F</span>aid my prayers and went to bed,
<br/>
<br/>
That's the l<span class="chord">C</span>ast they <span class="chord">C/B</span>saw <span class="chord">C/Bb</span>of    me <span class="chord">a</span>{}
<br/>

<br/>
Don't murder me,
<br/>
I beg of you, don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Wh<span class="chord">Bb</span>en <span class="chord">Am</span>I awoke, the Dire W<span class="chord">G</span>olf,
<br/>
<br/>
Six h<span class="chord">C</span>undred p<span class="chord">Bb</span>ounds of s<span class="chord">F</span>in,
<br/>
<br/>
W<span class="chord">F</span>as grinning at my window,
<br/>
<br/>
All I said was ``Come on <span class="chord">G</span>in''.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Don't murder <span class="chord">F</span>m<span class="chord">G</span>e,
<br/>
<br/>
I beg of y<span class="chord">C</span>ou, don't m<span class="chord">E7</span>urder m<span class="chord">a</span>e.
<br/>
<br/>
Pl<span class="chord">G</span>eas<span class="chord">F</span>e, don't murder m<span class="chord">C</span>e.
<br/>

<br/>
The Wolf came in, I got my cards,
<br/>
We sat down for a game.
<br/>
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades,
<br/>
But the cards were all the same.
<br/>
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
<br/>

<br/>
In the backwash of Fennario,
<br/>
The black and bloody mire,
<br/>
The Dire Wolf collects his due,
<br/>
While the boys sing 'round the fire.
<br/>

<br/>
Don't murder me,
<br/>
I beg of you, don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
<br/>

<br/>
No, no, no don't murder me.
<br/>
I beg of you, Don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
