<h3>Dire Wolf</h3>
<h4>Grateful Dead</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  In the t<span>G</span>imbers of Fennario,
<br/>
The w<span>Bb</span>olves are running r<span>F</span>ound,
<br/>
The w<span>F</span>inter was so hard and cold,
<br/>
Froze ten feet 'neath the gr<span>G</span>ound.
<br/>
Don't murder <span>F</span>m<span>G</span>e,
<br/>
I beg of y<span>C</span>ou, don't m<span>Bb</span>urder m<span>F</span>e.
<br/>
Ple<span>G</span>as<span>F</span>e, don't murder m<span>C</span>e.
<br/>

<br/>
I s<span>G</span>at down to my supper,
<br/>
'Tw<span>Bb</span>as a bottle of red whisk<span>F</span>y,
<br/>
I s<span>F</span>aid my prayers and went to bed,
<br/>
That's the l<span>C</span>ast they <span>C/B</span>saw <span>C/Bb</span>of    me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>a</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Don't murder me,
<br/>
I beg of you, don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
<br/>

<br/>
Wh<span>Bb</span>en <span>Am</span>I awoke, the Dire W<span>G</span>olf,
<br/>
Six h<span>C</span>undred p<span>Bb</span>ounds of s<span>F</span>in,
<br/>
W<span>F</span>as grinning at my window,
<br/>
All I said was ``Come on <span>G</span>in''.
<br/>

<br/>
Don't murder <span>F</span>m<span>G</span>e,
<br/>
I beg of y<span>C</span>ou, don't m<span>E7</span>urder m<span>a</span>e.
<br/>
Pl<span>G</span>eas<span>F</span>e, don't murder m<span>C</span>e.
<br/>

<br/>
The Wolf came in, I got my cards,
<br/>
We sat down for a game.
<br/>
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades,
<br/>
But the cards were all the same.
<br/>
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
<br/>

<br/>
In the backwash of Fennario,
<br/>
The black and bloody mire,
<br/>
The Dire Wolf collects his due,
<br/>
While the boys sing 'round the fire.
<br/>

<br/>
Don't murder me,
<br/>
I beg of you, don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
<br/>

<br/>
No, no, no don't murder me.
<br/>
I beg of you, Don't murder me.
<br/>
Please, don't murder me.
