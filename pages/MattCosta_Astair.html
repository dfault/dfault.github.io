<h3>Astair</h3>
<h4>Matt Costa</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Astair your glare is killing me
<br/>
Astair in skies of blue
<br/>
The signs you wear are making me
<br/>
So confused
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
But the mountains and the trees
<br/>
Are they just what you need
<br/>
Or are they less than what
<br/>
You'd expect to see
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
And if you're leaving well come
<br/>
Give me reason why I let you down
<br/>
Before you turn around now now
<br/>
Before you turn around
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
Astair you're there and I'm still here
<br/>
I swear I'm so confused
<br/>
The signs you wear are making me
<br/>
Feel like I'm the one to lose
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
But the canyons and the seas 
<br/>
Are they just what you need
<br/>
Or are they less than what
<br/>
You'd expect to see
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
And if you're leaving well come 
<br/>
Give me reason why I let you down
<br/>
Before you turn around now, now
<br/>
Before you turn around
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
But the mountains and the trees
<br/>
Are they just what you need
<br/>
Or are they less than what
<br/>
You'd expect to see
<br/>

<br/>
				
<br/>
				
<br/>
And if you're leaving well come 
<br/>
Give me reason why I let you down
<br/>
Before you turn around now, now
<br/>
Before you turn around
