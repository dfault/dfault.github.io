<h3>Under The Bridge</h3>
<h4>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>E</span>Sometimes <span>B</span>I feel like <span>C#m</span>I don't have a p<span>G#m</span>artne<span>A</span>r.
<br/>
<span>E</span>Sometimes <span>B</span>I feel like <span>C#m</span>my only f<span>A</span>riend,
<br/>
Is the <span>E</span>city I l<span>B</span>ive in, the city of angels
<br/>
<span>C#m</span>The city of <span>G#m</span>angel<span>A</span>s
<br/>
<span>E</span>Lonely as <span>B</span>I am <span>C#m</span>together we <span>A</span>cry<span>E7</span>   
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
<span>F#m</span>I don't ever want <span>E</span>to feel <span>B</span>like <span>F#m</span>I did that day.
<br/>
Take me to the place <span>E</span>I love, <span>B</span>take <span>F#m</span>me all the way,
<br/>

<br/>
<span>A</span>Under the bridge <span>C</span>down-town
<br/>
<span>G6</span>is where I <span>F7</span>drew some blood.
