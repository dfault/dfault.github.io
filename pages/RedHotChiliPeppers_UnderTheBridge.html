  <span>E</span>Sometimes <span>B</span>I feel like <span>C#m</span>I don't have a p<span>G#m</span>artne<span>A</span>r.

<span>E</span>Sometimes <span>B</span>I feel like <span>C#m</span>my only f<span>A</span>riend,
<br/>
Is the <span>E</span>city I l<span>B</span>ive in, the city of angels
<br/>
<span>C#m</span>The city of <span>G#m</span>angel<span>A</span>s
<br/>
<span>E</span>Lonely as <span>B</span>I am <span>C#m</span>together we <span>A</span>cry<span>E7</span>   
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
<br/>
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
<br/>
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
<br/>
I never worry, now that is a lie.
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I d<span>F#m</span>on't ever want to f<span>E/B</span>eel l<span>B</span>ike I d<span>F#m</span>id that day
<br/>
T<span>F#m</span>ake me to the place I l<span>E/B</span>ove, t<span>B</span>ake me a<span>F#m</span>ll the way

<br/>

<br/>
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
<br/>
It's hard to believe and I'm all alone
<br/>
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
<br/>
Lonely as I am, together we cry
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
<br/>
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
<br/>
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
