<h3>Burn One Down</h3>
<h4>Ben Harper</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Let u<span>G</span>s burn one from end to end
<br/>
and p<span>Em</span>ass it over to m<span>C</span>e my friend
<br/>
bu<span>G</span>rn it long, we'll burn it slow
<br/>
to l<span>Em</span>ight me up be<span>C</span>fore I go 
<br/>

<br/>
if y<span>G</span>ou don't like my fire
<br/>
then d<span>Em</span>on't come around
<br/>
cause I'm gonna b<span>D</span>urn one dow<span>C</span>n
<br/>
ye<span>Em</span>s I'm gonna b<span>D</span>urn one dow<span>G</span>n
<br/>

<br/>
my choice is what I choose to do
<br/>
and if I'm causing no harm it shouldn't bother you
<br/>
your choice is who you choose to be
<br/>
and if your causin' no harm then you're alright with me 
<br/>

<br/>
if y<span>G</span>ou don't like my fire
<br/>
then d<span>Em</span>on't come around
<br/>
caus<span>D</span>e I'm gonna b<span>C</span>urn one dow<span>G</span>n
<br/>
ye<span>Em</span>s I'm gonna b<span>D</span>urn one dow<span>C</span>n
<br/>

<br/>
herb the gift from the earth
<br/>
and what's from the earth is of the greatest worth
<br/>
so before you knock it try it first
<br/>
you'll see it's a blessing and not a curse 
<br/>

<br/>
if y<span>G</span>ou don't like my fire
<br/>
then d<span>Em</span>on't come around
<br/>
caus<span>D</span>e I'm gonna b<span>C</span>urn one dow<span>G</span>n
<br/>
ye<span>Em</span>s I'm gonna b<span>D</span>urn one dow<span>C</span>n
