<h3>The Shining</h3>
<h4>Badly Drawn Boy</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>E</span>Faith pours from your <span>Amaj7</span>walls, drowning your <span>E</span>calls
<br/>
I've tried to <span>Amaj7</span>hear, you're not <span>E</span>near <span>Amaj7</span> 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Remembering when I saw your face
<br/>
Shining my way, pure timing
<br/>
Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep
<br/>
It's killing me, I'm dying
<br/>

<br/>
To <span>B</span>put a little bit of <span>A</span>sunshine in your <span>E</span>life
<br/>

<br/>
<span>E</span>Soleil <span>A</span>all over <span>E</span>you, warm sun <span>A</span>pours over <span>E</span>me
<br/>
Soleil <span>A</span>all over <span>E</span>you
<br/>
Warm sun <span>A</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>

<br/>
Now this slick fallen rift came like a gift
<br/>
Your body moves ever nearer
<br/>
And you will dry this tear
<br/>
Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history
<br/>
But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain
<br/>
Then it's replaced, sun setting
<br/>

<br/>
And <span>B</span>suddenly you're in <span>A</span>love with every<span>E</span>thing
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>E</span>Soleil <span>A</span>all over <span>E</span>you, warm sun <span>A</span>pours over <span>E</span>me
<br/>
Soleil <span>A</span>all over <span>E</span>you
<br/>
Warm sun <span>A</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
