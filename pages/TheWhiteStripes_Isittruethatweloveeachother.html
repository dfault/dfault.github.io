<h3>Is it true that we love each other?</h3>
<h4>The White Stripes</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  W<span>A</span>ell, it's true that we love one another,
<br/>
I <span>A</span>love Jack White like a little brother.
<br/>
W<span>E</span>ell, Holly, I love you too, <span>D</span>but there's just so much,
<br/>
T<span>D</span>hat I dont know about y<span>A</span>ou.
<br/>

<br/>
Jack gimme some money, to pay my bills,
<br/>
All the dough i give you Holly you been usin' on pain pills.
<br/>
Jack, will you call me if you're able?
<br/>
Got your phone number written on the back of my bottle.
<br/>

<br/>
Jack I think you're pulling my leg,
<br/>
And I think maybe I better ask Meg.
<br/>
Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?
<br/>
You know I don't care 'cause Jack really bugs me.
<br/>

<br/>
Why don't you ask him now?
<br/>
Well, I would, but Meg I really just don't know how.
<br/>
Just say, ''Jack, do you adore me?''
<br/>
Well, I would, Holly, but love really bores me.
<br/>

<br/>
Holly gimme some of your English lovin',
<br/>
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven.
<br/>
Why don't you go off and love yourself?
<br/>
If I did that, Holly, there won't be anything left for anybody else.
<br/>

<br/>
Jack it's too bad about the way that you look.
<br/>
Y'know I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot.
<br/>
Will the two of you cut it out,
<br/>
And tell 'em what it's really all about?
<br/>
