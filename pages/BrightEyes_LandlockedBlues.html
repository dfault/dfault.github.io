<h3>Landlocked Blues</h3>
<h4>Bright Eyes</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  (Capo 3rd fret)
<br/>

<br/>
If <span>C</span>you walk away, <span>G</span>I’ll walk <span>C</span>away
<br/>
First <span>C</span>tell me which <span>G</span>road you will <span>C</span>take
<br/>
I <span>Am</span>don’t want to <span>G</span>risk our paths <span>C</span>crossing some <span>Am</span>day
<br/>
So you <span>C</span>walk that way, <span>G</span>I’ll walk this <span>C</span>way
<br/>

<br/>
And the future hangs over our heads
<br/>
And it moves with each current event
<br/>
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
<br/>
Just stay in when it’s looking this way
<br/>

<br/>
And the moon’s laying low in the sky
<br/>
Forcing everything metal to shine
<br/>
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
<br/>
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way
<br/>

<br/>
And Laura’s asleep in my bed
<br/>
As I’m leaving she wakes up and says
<br/>
“I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
<br/>
Baby don’t go away, come here”
<br/>

<br/>
And there’s kids playing guns in the street
<br/>
And ones pointing his tree branch at me
<br/>
So I put my hands up I say “enough is enough,
<br/>
If you walk away, I’ll walk away”
<br/>
And he shot me dead
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>I found a <span>G</span>liquid <span>C</span>cure
<br/>
<span>Am</span>From my <span>G</span>landlocked <span>C</span>blues
<br/>
<span>F</span>It’ll pass aw<span>G</span>ay like a <span>C</span>slow par<span>Am</span>ade
<br/>
It’s <span>C</span>leaving but I <span>G</span>don’t know how <span>C</span>soon
<br/>

<br/>
And the world’s got me dizzy again
<br/>
You think after 22 years I’d be used to the spin
<br/>
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
<br/>
So I’m always pacing around or walking away
<br/>
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
<br/>
And I’m balancing history books up on my head
<br/>
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
<br/>
If you love something, give it away
<br/>

<br/>
A good woman will pick you apart
<br/>
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
<br/>
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
<br/>
But don’t walk away, don’t walk away
<br/>

<br/>
We made love on the living room floor
<br/>
With the noise in the background of a televised war
<br/>
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
<br/>
“If we walk away, they’ll walk away”
<br/>

<br/>
But greed is a bottomless pit
<br/>
And our freedom’s a joke
<br/>
We’re just taking a piss
<br/>
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
<br/>
If you’re still free start running away
<br/>
Cause we’re coming for you!
<br/>

<br/>
I’ve grown tired of holding this pose
<br/>
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
<br/>
So I’m making a deal with the devils of fame
<br/>
Saying “let me walk away, please”
<br/>
You’ll be free child once you have died
<br/>
From the shackles of language and measurable time
<br/>
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
<br/>
Till then walk away, walk away
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>So I’m <span>G</span>up at <span>C</span>dawn
<br/>
<span>Am</span>Putting <span>G</span>on my <span>C</span>shoes
<br/>
I <span>F</span>just want to <span>G</span>make a <span>C</span>clean esc<span>Am</span>ape
<br/>
I’m <span>Am</span>leaving but I <span>G</span>don’t know where <span>C</span>to
<br/>
I know I’m <span>Am</span>leaving but I <span>G</span>don’t know where <span>C</span>to
