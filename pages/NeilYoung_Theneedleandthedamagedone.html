<h3>The needle and the damage done</h3>
<h4>Neil Young</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
<br/>
I love you, baby, can I have some more
<br/>
Ooh, ooh, the damage done.
<br/>

<br/>
I hit the city and I lost my band
<br/>
I watched the needle take another man
<br/>
Gone, gone, the damage done.
<br/>

<br/>
I sing the song because I love the man
<br/>
I know that some of you don't understand
<br/>
Milk-blood to keep from running out.
<br/>

<br/>
I've seen the needle and the damage done
<br/>
A little part of it in everyone
<br/>
But every junkie's like a settin' sun.
