<h3>That's when I Reach for my Revolver</h3>
<h4>Mission of Burma</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  O<span>E</span>nce I had my heroes
<br/>
Once I had my dreams
<br/>
But all of that is changed now
<br/>
G<span>A</span>ots twisted inside out
<br/>
T<span>C</span>he truth is not that comfortable, no
<br/>

<br/>
Mother taught us patience
<br/>
The virtues of restraint
<br/>
Father taught us boundaries
<br/>
The knowledge we must go
<br/>
I'm trying to protect my unity
<br/>

<br/>
Th<span>B</span>at's wh<span>A</span>en I r<span>C#m</span>each for my r<span>D#</span>evolver
<br/>
That's when it all gets blown away
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That feeling passes by this way
<br/>

<br/>
A friend of mine once told me
<br/>
His one and only aim
<br/>
To build a giant castle
<br/>
And in it sign his name
<br/>
The silence wraps us in its chains
<br/>

<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That's when it all gets blown away
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That feeling passes by this way
<br/>

<br/>
And now the sky is empty
<br/>
But that is nothing new
<br/>
The dead eyes look upon us
<br/>
And they tell me 
<br/>
we're nothing 
<br/>

<br/>
but then
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
<br/>
That's when I reach for my revolver
