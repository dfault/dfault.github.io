  I <span>C</span>wish I <span>Cmaj7</span>had a <span>C7</span>parachute cuz I'm <span>F</span>falling bad for <span>G7</span>you <span>G</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
And I can <span>C</span>see the <span>Cmaj7</span>ground appr<span>C7</span>oaching now
<br/>
But I'm <span>F</span>not sure what to <span>G7</span>do <span>G</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
I <span>Am</span>feel like a <span>D/F#</span>pinata once you <span>F</span>take a swing at <span>G7</span>me <span>G</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
If <span>Am</span>you could just crack the <span>D/F#</span>shell open
<br/>
I think <span>F</span>inside you would <span>G</span>find something <span>C</span>sweet. <span>F</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$ <span>C</span>
<br/>

<br/>
And I hear you like a hunter now, your footsteps in the leaves
<br/>
And I would gladly leave my hiding place
<br/>
So I'm hoping to be seen.
<br/>
So let your arrow fly
<br/>
And see I'm well within your aim
<br/>
And lay your traps for a thousand miles
<br/>
And please don't let me escape.
<br/>

<br/>
Winter came to Omaha and left us looking like a bride
<br/>
A million perfect snowflakes now
<br/>
And no two are alike
<br/>
And so it's hard for me imagining flaws in this design
<br/>
I know debris, it covers everything
<br/>
But still I am in love with this life.
