  <br/>
I <span class="chord">C</span>wish I <span class="chord">Cmaj7</span>had a <span class="chord">C7</span>parachute cuz I'm <span class="chord">F</span>falling<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp bad for <span class="chord">G7</span>you <span class="chord">G</span> $ $
<br/>
<br/>
And I can <span class="chord">C</span>see the <span class="chord">Cmaj7</span>ground appr<span class="chord">C7</span>oaching now
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm <span class="chord">F</span>not sure what to <span class="chord">G7</span>do <span class="chord">G</span> $ $
<br/>
<br/>
I <span class="chord">Am</span>feel like a <span class="chord">D/F#</span>pinata once you <span class="chord">F</span>take a swing at<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">G7</span>me <span class="chord">G</span> $ $
<br/>
<br/>
If <span class="chord">Am</span>you could just crack the <span class="chord">D/F#</span>shell open
<br/>
<br/>
I think <span class="chord">F</span>inside you would <span class="chord">G</span>find something <span class="chord">C</span>sweet. <span class="chord">F</span><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp $ $ <span class="chord">C</span>
<br/>

<br/>
And I hear you like a hunter now, your footsteps in the<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp leaves
<br/>
And I would gladly leave my hiding place
<br/>
So I'm hoping to be seen.
<br/>
So let your arrow fly
<br/>
And see I'm well within your aim
<br/>
And lay your traps for a thousand miles
<br/>
And please don't let me escape.
<br/>

<br/>
Winter came to Omaha and left us looking like a bride
<br/>
A million perfect snowflakes now
<br/>
And no two are alike
<br/>
And so it's hard for me imagining flaws in this design
<br/>
I know debris, it covers everything
<br/>
But still I am in love with this life.
