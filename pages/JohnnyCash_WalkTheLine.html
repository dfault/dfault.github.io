<h3>Walk The Line</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">A</span>I keep a <span class="chord">E</span>close watch on this heart of <span class="chord">A</span>mine
<br/>
<br/>
I keep my <span class="chord">E</span>eyes wide open all the <span class="chord">A</span>time
<br/>
<br/>
I keep the <span class="chord">D</span>ends out for the tie that <span class="chord">A</span>binds
<br/>
<br/>
Because you're <span class="chord">E</span>mine, I walk the <span class="chord">A</span>line
<br/>

<br/>
I find it very, very easy to be true
<br/>
I find myself alone when each day is through
<br/>
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
<br/>
Because you're mine, I walk the line
<br/>

<br/>
As sure as night is dark and day is light
<br/>
I keep you on my mind both day and night
<br/>
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
<br/>
Because you're mine, I walk the line
<br/>

<br/>
You've got a way to keep me on your side
<br/>
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
<br/>
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
<br/>
Because you're mine, I walk the line
<br/>

<br/>
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
<br/>
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
<br/>
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
<br/>
Because you're mine, I walk the line
<br/>
