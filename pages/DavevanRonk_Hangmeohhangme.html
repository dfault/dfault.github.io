<br/>
All around cape Giradeau
<br/>
Parts of Arkansas
<br/>
Got so god damn hungry
<br/>
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy
<br/>
I been all around this world
<br/>

<br/>
Went up on a mountain
<br/>
There i made my stand
<br/>
Went up on a mountain
<br/>
There i made my stand
<br/>
Rifle on my shoulder
<br/>
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy
<br/>
I been all around this world
<br/>

<br/>
So hang me, oh hang me
<br/>
I'll be dead and gone
<br/>
Hang me, oh hang me
<br/>
And i'll be dead and gone
<br/>
I wouldn't mind the hanging
<br/>
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
<br/>
I been all around this world
<br/>

<br/>
Put the rope around my neck
<br/>
And hung me up so high
<br/>
Put the rope around my neck
<br/>
Hung me up so high
<br/>
Last words i heard 'em say
<br/>
Won't be long now for you die, poor boy
<br/>
I been all around this world
<br/>

<br/>
So hang me, oh hang men
<br/>
I'll be dead and gone
<br/>
Hang me, oh hang me
<br/>
I'll be dead and gone
<br/>
I wouldn't mind the hanging
<br/>
But the layin' in a grave, poor boy
<br/>
I been all around this world
