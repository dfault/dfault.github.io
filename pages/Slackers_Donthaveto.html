<h3>Dont have to</h3>
<h4>Slackers</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  I spent thr<span>F</span>ee years learning how to talk
<br/>
The next th<span>Bb</span>irty learning n<span>F</span>ot to
<br/>
Tw<span>F</span>o years learning how to walk
<br/>
About the s<span>G7</span>ame for a motorc<span>C7</span>ycle
<br/>
E<span>F</span>ight years living in a powder keg
<br/>
But only a m<span>Bb</span>oment to light a m<span>F</span>atch
<br/>
But then <span>F</span>I found you and you f<span>D7</span>ound me too
<br/>
And n<span>Bb</span>ow I j<span>C7</span>ust don't h<span>F</span>ave to
<br/>

<br/>
I walked five miles up a hill through a foot of snow
<br/>
To make a phone call home on your birthday
<br/>
I swam eight miles fighting off a hammerhead shark
<br/>
To get your present there by Thursday
<br/>
Climb a thousand foot hill using only one hand
<br/>
Just to tell the world of my convictions
<br/>
But you already knew that our love grew
<br/>
And now I just don't have to
<br/>

<br/>
I spent no time taking you for granted
<br/>
And I guess that I never will now
<br/>
A lot of time thinking about your love
<br/>
A'cause it's giving me such a thrill now
<br/>
Sunday morning I'm thanking the Lord for you
<br/>
With a quick nod to the devil
<br/>
I was so blue, just fighting for you
<br/>
And now I just don't have to
<br/>

<br/>
Uh<span>Bb</span>uh, I j<span>C7</span>ust don't h<span>F</span>ave to
<br/>
I said n<span>Bb</span>ow I j<span>C7</span>ust don't h<span>F</span>ave to
<br/>
<span>Bb</span>I j<span>C7</span>ust don't... H<span>F</span>ave to
