like the o<span class="chord">Dm</span>ld woman of the desert

<br/>
<br/>
the t<span class="chord">Gm</span>eachers of such pathways

<br/>
that would o<span class="chord">C</span>nly ever teach for free

<br/>
when finally hitting 40
<br/>
the losses seem to quicken
<br/>
as if an extra season was added
<br/>
each year just for the stricken
<br/>

<br/>
losses by the numbers
<br/>
disasters by the score
<br/>
when the art of acceptance
<br/>
can't even expect you to accept any more
<br/>

<br/>
that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger
<br/>

<br/>
now i amble over 50
<br/>
and the longest hours move so swiftly
<br/>
such young fresh folk
<br/>
look to me as such path finder
<br/>
and it's in my crinkel smile
<br/>
in my smoldering spark eyed glisten
<br/>
I strug them to be so quiet for just a while
<br/>
and give your own heart a good listen
<br/>

<br/>
