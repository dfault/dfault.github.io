<h3>Breaking a girl</h3>
<h4>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  I Am a man
<br/>
Cut from the know
<br/>
Rarely do friends
<br/>
Come and then go
<br/>
She was a girl
<br/>
Soft but estranged
<br/>
We were the two
<br/>
Our lives rearranged
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>Feeling so <span>D</span>good that <span>Em</span>da<span>G</span>y
<br/>
A feeling of <span>D</span>love that d<span>C</span>ay
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Em</span>Twisting and <span>D/F#</span>turning
<br/>
Your f<span>G</span>eelings are b<span>Am</span>urning
<br/>
You're <span>B</span>breaking the <span>B/A</span>girl<span>B/G</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>B/F#</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>
<span>Em</span>She <span>D/F#</span>meant <span>G</span>you <span>Am</span>no h<span>C</span>arm
<br/>
<span>Em</span>Think you're so c<span>D/F#</span>lever
<br/>
But <span>G</span>now you must s<span>Am</span>ever
<br/>
You're <span>B</span>breaking the <span>B/A</span>girl<span>B/G</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>B/F#</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/>
<span>Em</span>He l<span>D/F#</span>oves <span>G</span>no <span>am</span>one <span>C</span>els<span>C7</span>e
<br/>

<br/>
Raised by my dad
<br/>
Girl of the day
<br/>
He was my man
<br/>
That was the way
<br/>
She was the girl
<br/>
Left alone
<br/>
Feeling the need
<br/>
To make me her home
<br/>

<br/>
I don't know what when or why
<br/>
The twilight of love had arrived
<br/>

<br/>
Twisting and turning
<br/>
Your feelings are burning
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
She meant you no harm
<br/>
Think you're so clever
<br/>
But now you must sever
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
He loves no one else
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Twisting and turning
<br/>
Your feelings are burning
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
She meant you no harm
<br/>
Think you're so clever
<br/>
But now you must sever
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
He loves no one else
