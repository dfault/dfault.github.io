I Am a man
<br/>
Cut from the know
<br/>
Rarely do friends
<br/>
Come and then go
<br/>
She was a girl
<br/>
Soft but estranged
<br/>
We were the two
<br/>
Our lives rearranged
<br/>

<br/>
Raised by my dad
<br/>
Girl of the day
<br/>
He was my man
<br/>
That was the way
<br/>
She was the girl
<br/>
Left alone
<br/>
Feeling the need
<br/>
To make me her home
<br/>

<br/>
I don't know what when or why
<br/>
The twilight of love had arrived
<br/>

<br/>
Twisting and turning
<br/>
Your feelings are burning
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
She meant you no harm
<br/>
Think you're so clever
<br/>
But now you must sever
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
He loves no one else
<br/>

<br/>
Twisting and turning
<br/>
Your feelings are burning
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
She meant you no harm
<br/>
Think you're so clever
<br/>
But now you must sever
<br/>
You're breaking the girl
<br/>
He loves no one else
