<h3>It Ain't me Babe</h3>
<h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>G</span>Go 'way from my <span>C</span>window <span>G</span>leave at your <span>D</span>own chosen <span>G</span>speed
<br/>
<span>G</span>I'm not the one you <span>C</span>want, Babe, I'm <span>G</span>not the <span>D</span>one you <span>G</span>need.
<br/>
You <span>Bm</span>say you're looking <span>Am</span>for someone never <span>Bm</span>weak but always <span>Am</span>strong
<br/>
To prot<span>Bm</span>ect you and def<span>Am</span>end you whether <span>Bm</span>you are right or <span>Am</span>wrong
<br/>
Some<span>C</span>one to open each and every <span>D</span>door
<br/>
But it ain't m<span>G</span>e, Babe,
<br/>
<span>C</span>No, no, n<span>D</span>o, it ain't m<span>G</span>e, Babe,
<br/>
It ain't <span>C</span>me you're l<span>D</span>ooking f<span>G</span>or, Babe. 
<br/>

<br/>
Go lightly from the ledge, Babe, go lightly on the ground,
<br/>
I'm not the one you want, Babe, I will only let you down.
<br/>
You say you're looking for someone 
<br/>
who will promise never to part
<br/>
Someone to close his eyes for you, someone to close his heart
<br/>
Someone who will die for you and more 
<br/>
But it ain't me, Babe,
<br/>
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
<br/>
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.
<br/>

<br/>
Go melt back in the night, Babe, 
<br/>
everything inside is made of stone,
<br/>
There's nothing in here moving and anyway I'm not alone
<br/>
You say you're looking for someone 
<br/>
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
<br/>
To gather flowers constantly and to come each time you call
<br/>
A love of your life and nothing more 
<br/>
But it ain't me, Babe,
<br/>
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
<br/>
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.
<br/>
