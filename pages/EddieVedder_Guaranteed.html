<br/>
On bended knee is no way to be free
<br/>
Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently
<br/>
All my destinations will accept the one that's me
<br/>
So I can breathe
<br/>

<br/>
Circles they grow and they swallow people whole
<br/>
Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp know
<br/>
A mind full of questions, and a teacher in my soul
<br/>
And so it goes
<br/>

<br/>
Don't come closer or I'll have to go
<br/>
Holding me like gravity are places that pull
<br/>
If ever there was someone to keep me at home
<br/>
It would be you
<br/>

<br/>
Everyone I come across, in cages they bought
<br/>
They think of me and my wandering, but I'm never what they<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp thought
<br/>
I've got my indignation, but I'm pure in all my thoughts
<br/>
I'm alive
<br/>

<br/>
Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
<br/>
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared
<br/>
Late at night I hear the trees, they're singing with the<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp dead
<br/>
Overhead
<br/>

<br/>
Leave it to me as I find a way to be
<br/>
Consider me a satellite, forever orbiting
<br/>
I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me
<br/>
Guaranteed
<br/>
