<h3>Frank Sinatra</h3>
<h4>Cake</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  We know of an ancient radiation
<br/>
That haunts dismembered constellations,
<br/>
A faintly glimmering radio station.
<br/>
While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather,
<br/>
The flies and spiders get along together,
<br/>
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record. 
<br/>

<br/>
Beyond the suns that guard this roof,
<br/>
Beyond your flowers of flaming truths,
<br/>
Beyond your latest ad campaigns,
<br/>
An old man sits collecting stamps
<br/>
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps.
<br/>
He saves what others throw away.
<br/>
He says that he'll be rich some day.
<br/>

<br/>
We know of an ancient radiation
<br/>
That haunts dismembered constellations,
<br/>
A faintly glimmering radio station.
