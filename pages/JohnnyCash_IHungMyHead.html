<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>Early one morning
<br/>
With <span>F</span>time to kill
<br/>
I <span>Am</span>borrowed Jebb's rifle
<br/>
And <span>F</span>sat on a hill
<br/>
I <span>C</span>saw a lone rider
<br/>
<span>F</span>Crossing the plain
<br/>
I <span>Am</span>drew a bead on him
<br/>
To <span>F</span>practice my aim
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>My brother's rifle
<br/>
Went <span>G</span>of in my hand
<br/>
<span>C</span>A shot rang out
<br/>
Across the land
<br/>
The <span>F</span>horse, he kept running
<br/>
The <span>Am</span>rider was dead
<br/>
<span>C</span>I hung my head
<br/>
<span>F</span>I hung my head
<br/>

<br/>
I set off running
<br/>
To wake from the dream
<br/>
My brother's rifle
<br/>
Went into the sheen
<br/>
I kept on running
<br/>
Into the south lands
<br/>
That's where they found me
<br/>
My head and my hands
<br/>
The sheriff he asked me
<br/>
Why had I run
<br/>
And then it came to me
<br/>
Just what I had done
<br/>
And all for no reason
<br/>
Just one peace of lead
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>

<br/>
Here in the court house
<br/>
The whole town was there
<br/>
I see the judge
<br/>
High up in the chair
<br/>
Explain to the court room
<br/>
What went through you mind
<br/>
And we'll ask the jury
<br/>
What verdict they find
<br/>
I felt the power
<br/>
Of death over life
<br/>
I orphaned his children
<br/>
I widowed his wife
<br/>
I begged their forgiveness
<br/>
I wish I was dead
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>

<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>

<br/>
Early one morning
<br/>
With time to kill
<br/>
I see the gallows
<br/>
Up on a hill
<br/>
And out in the distance
<br/>
A trick of the brain
<br/>
I see a lone rider
<br/>
Crossing the plain
<br/>
And he'd come to fetch me
<br/>
To see what they'd done
<br/>
And we'd ride together
<br/>
To kingdom come
<br/>
I prayed for god's mercy
<br/>
For soon I'd be dead
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>

<br/>
I hung my head
<br/>
I hung my head
