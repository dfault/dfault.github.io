<h3>Tangled up in blue</h3>
<h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  
<br/>
E<span>A</span>arly one mornin' the s<span>G6</span>un was shinin',
<br/>
<span>A</span>I was layin' in b<span>G6</span>ed
<br/>
W<span>A</span>ond'rin' if she'd c<span>G6</span>hanged at all
<br/>
If her h<span>D</span>air was still red.
<br/>
H<span>A</span>er folks they said our l<span>G6</span>ives together
<br/>
S<span>A</span>ure was gonna be r<span>G6</span>ough
<br/>
T<span>A</span>hey never did like Mama's h<span>G6</span>omemade dress
<br/>
Papa's b<span>D</span>ankbook wasn't big enough.
<br/>

<br/>
A<span>E</span>nd I was standin' on the side o<span>F#m</span>f the road
<br/>
R<span>A</span>ain fallin' on my s<span>D</span>hoes
<br/>
H<span>E</span>eading out for the E<span>F#m</span>ast Coast
<br/>
Lord k<span>A</span>nows I've paid some d<span>D</span>ues gettin' t<span>E</span>hrough,
<br/>
T<span>G</span>angled u<span>D</span>p in b<span>A|Asus</span>lue.
<br/>

<br/>
She was married when we first met
<br/>
Soon to be divorced
<br/>
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
<br/>
But I used a little too much force.
<br/>
We drove that car as far as we could
<br/>
Abandoned it out West
<br/>
Split up on a dark sad night
<br/>
Both agreeing it was best.
<br/>

<br/>
She turned around to look at me
<br/>
As I was walkin' away
<br/>
I heard her say over my shoulder,
<br/>
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"
<br/>
Tangled up in blue.
<br/>

<br/>
I had a job in the great north woods
<br/>
Working as a cook for a spell
<br/>
But I never did like it all that much
<br/>
And one day the ax just fell.
<br/>
So I drifted down to New Orleans
<br/>
Where I happened to be employed
<br/>
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
<br/>
Right outside of Delacroix.
<br/>

<br/>
But all the while I was alone
<br/>
The past was close behind,
<br/>
I seen a lot of women
<br/>
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
<br/>
Tangled up in blue.
<br/>

<br/>
She was workin' in a topless place
<br/>
And I stopped in for a beer,
<br/>
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
<br/>
In the spotlight so clear.
<br/>
And later on as the crowd thinned out
<br/>
I's just about to do the same,
<br/>
She was standing there in back of my chair
<br/>
Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
<br/>

<br/>
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
<br/>
She studied the lines on my face.
<br/>
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
<br/>
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
<br/>
Tangled up in blue.
<br/>

<br/>
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
<br/>
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
<br/>
"You look like the silent type."
<br/>
Then she opened up a book of poems
<br/>
And handed it to me
<br/>
Written by an Italian poet
<br/>
From the thirteenth century.
<br/>
       
<br/>

<br/>
And every one of them words rang true
<br/>
And glowed like burnin' coal
<br/>
Pourin' off of every page
<br/>
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
<br/>
Tangled up in blue.
<br/>

<br/>
I lived with them on Montague Street
<br/>
In a basement down the stairs,
<br/>
There was music in the cafes at night
<br/>
And revolution in the air.
<br/>
Then he started into dealing with slaves
<br/>
And something inside of him died.
<br/>
She had to sell everything she owned
<br/>
And froze up inside.
<br/>

<br/>
And when finally the bottom fell out
<br/>
I became withdrawn,
<br/>
The only thing I knew how to do
<br/>
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
<br/>
Tangled up in blue.
<br/>

<br/>
So now I'm goin' back again,
<br/>
I got to get to her somehow.
<br/>
All the people we used to know
<br/>
They're an illusion to me now.
<br/>
Some are mathematicians
<br/>
Some are carpenter's wives.
<br/>
Don't know how it all got started,
<br/>
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
<br/>

<br/>
But me, I'm still on the road
<br/>
Headin' for another joint
<br/>
We always did feel the same,
<br/>
We just saw it from a different point of view,
<br/>
Tangled up in blue.
