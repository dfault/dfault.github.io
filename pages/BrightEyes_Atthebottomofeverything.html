<span class="chord">C</span>we must talk in every telephone get <span class="chord">F</span>eaten off the<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">C</span>web
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>we must rip out all the epilogues in the <span class="chord">F</span>books that we<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp have <span class="chord">G</span>read 
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>and to the face of every criminal <span class="chord">F</span>strapped firmly to a<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp chair
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>we must stare, we must stare, <span class="chord">G</span>we must <span class="chord">C</span>stare
<br/>

<br/>
we must take all of the medicines to expensive now to<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp <span class="chord">C</span>sell
<br/>
set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell
<br/>
and to the ear of every anarchist who sleeps but doesn't<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp dream
<br/>
we must sing, we must sing, we must sing
<br/>

<br/>
it'll go like this alright
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>While my mother <span class="chord">G</span>waters plants my father <span class="chord">C</span>loads his<br/>

&nbsp&nbsp the setting <span class="chord">F</span>sun
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">G</span>is returned to the lonesome ocean
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
we must blend into the choir sing a static with the whole
<br/>
we must memorize 9 numbers and deny we have a soul
<br/>
and in this endless race for property and privilege to be<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp won
<br/>
we must run, we must run, we must run
<br/>

<br/>
we must hang up in the belphry where the bats and moonlight<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp laugh
<br/>
we must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
<br/>
and into the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlight<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp and our love
<br/>
we must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge
<br/>

<br/>
oh my mornings coming back the whole worlds waking up
<br/>
all the city buses swimming past i'm happy just because 
<br/>
i found out i'm really no one
<br/>
