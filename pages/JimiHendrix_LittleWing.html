<h3>Little Wing</h3>
<h4>Jimi Hendrix</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Now she's w<span>Em</span>alking through th<span>G</span>e clouds
<br/>
With a c<span>Am</span>ircus mind that's running w<span>Em</span>ild
<br/>
B<span>Bm</span>utterflies and zebras a<span>Am</span>nd moonbeams, and fairy t<span>C</span>al<span>G</span>es
<br/>
A<span>F</span>ll she ever thinks about is 
<br/>
R<span>C</span>id<span>D</span>ing with the wind
<br/>

<br/>
When I'm sad she comes to me
<br/>
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
<br/>
It's alright, it's alright she says
<br/>
Take anything you want from me\ldots
<br/>
Anything
<br/>
