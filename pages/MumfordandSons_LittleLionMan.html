<br/>
<span>Am</span>Weep for yourself, my man,
<br/>
you'll never be what is in your <span>C</span>heart.
<br/>
<span>Am</span>Weep little lion man,
<br/>
you're not as brave as you were at the <span>C</span>start.
<br/>
<span>G</span>Rate yourself and rape yourself,
<br/>
<span>F</span>take all the <span>Fmaj7</span>courage you have <span>C</span>left.
<br/>
<span>G</span>Wasted on fixing all the
<br/>
<span>F</span>problems that you <span>Fmaj7</span>made in your own <span>C</span>head.
<br/>

<br/>
But it was <span>Am</span>not your f<span>F</span>ault but m<span>C</span>ine,
<br/>
and it was <span>am</span>your hear<span>F</span>t on the l<span>C</span>ine.
<br/>
I really f<span>Am</span>ucked it <span>F</span>up this t<span>C</span>ime,
<br/>
didn't I, my d<span>G</span>ear?
<br/>
Didn't I, my de<span>Am</span>ar?
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>Tremble for yourself my man,
<br/>
you know that you have seen this all be<span>C</span>fore.
<br/>
<span>Am</span>Tremble little lion man,
<br/>
you'll never settle any of your <span>C</span>scores.
<br/>
<span>G</span>Your grace is wasted in your face,
<br/>
your <span>F</span>boldness stands <span>Fmaj7</span>alone among the w<span>C</span>reck.
<br/>
<span>G</span>Learn from your mother or else
<br/>
<span>F</span>spend your days b<span>Fmaj7</span>iting your own n<span>C</span>eck.
<br/>

<br/>
But it was <span>Am</span>not your f<span>F</span>ault but m<span>C</span>ine,
<br/>
and it was <span>am</span>your hear<span>F</span>t on the l<span>C</span>ine.
<br/>
I really f<span>Am</span>ucked it <span>F</span>up this t<span>C</span>ime,
