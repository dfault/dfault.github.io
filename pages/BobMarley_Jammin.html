No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we wont bow;
<br/>
Neither can be bought nor sold.
<br/>
We all defend the right; jah - jah children must unite:
<br/>
Your life is worth much more than gold.
<br/>

<br/>
Were jammin, And were jammin in the name of the lord;
<br/>
Were jammin, Were jammin right straight from yah.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>Bm</span>And rules all creation.

<br/>
Were jammin, Im jammed: I hope youre jammin, too
<br/>

<br/>
Jams about my pride and truth I cannot hide
<br/>
To keep you satisfied.
<br/>
True love that now exist is the love I cant resist,
<br/>
So jam by my side.
