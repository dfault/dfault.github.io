<h3>The Wind Cries Mary</h3>
<h4>Jimi Hendrix</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  A<span>C</span>fter all the j<span>Bb</span>acks are in their b<span>F</span>oxes
<br/>
A<span>C</span>nd the clowns have a<span>Bb</span>ll gone to b<span>F</span>ed
<br/>
Y<span>C</span>ou can hear happiness st<span>Bb</span>aggering on d<span>F</span>own the street
<br/>
F<span>G</span>ootsteps d<span>Bb</span>ressed in r<span>Eb</span>ed
<br/>
A<span>G</span>nd the w<span>Bb</span>ind whispers M<span>Eb</span>ary
<br/>

<br/>
A broom is drearily sweeping
<br/>
Up the broken peices of yesterday's life
<br/>
Somewhere a queen is weeping
<br/>
Somewhere a king has no wife
<br/>
And the wind cries Mary
<br/>

<br/>
The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
<br/>
And shine the emptyness down on my bed
<br/>
The tiny island sags downstream
<br/>
Cause the life that lived is dead
<br/>
And the wind screams Mary
<br/>

<br/>
Will the wind ever remember
<br/>
The names it has blown in the past
<br/>
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
<br/>
It whispers no, this will be the last
<br/>
And the wind cries Mary
