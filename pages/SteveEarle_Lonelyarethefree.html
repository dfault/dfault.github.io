<h3>Lonely are the free</h3>
<h4>Steve Earle</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  (Capo 4th fret)
<br/>

<br/>
<span>A</span>Lonely are the free, there ain't that many of them
<br/>
They don't <span>f#</span>walk like you and me
<br/>

<br/>
They just <span>A</span>tumble in the breeze, lighter than a feather
<br/>
All to<span>f#</span>gether, separately
<br/>

<br/>
That's <span>D</span>how it's s'posed to be, no matter where they wander
<br/>
From <span>f#</span>post to in between, from here to over yonder
<br/>
There's no <span>A</span>place for them to land
<br/>
<span>f#</span>Lonely are the free
<br/>

<br/>
The silent are the strong, not so much as a whisper
<br/>
Tells you anything is wrong
<br/>

<br/>
You've known all along, but you can't help but listen
<br/>
And now the moment's gone
<br/>

<br/>
It keeps you hanging on, until the stillness signaling
<br/>
The breaking of the dawn, is shattered by the sirens
<br/>
Singing sacrificial songs
<br/>
The silent are the strong
<br/>

<br/>
That's all they used to see, a violent shadow passing 'cross
<br/>
The sun so fleetingly, that if you have to ask you miss it
<br/>
Anyway you see
<br/>
Lonely are the free
<br/>
Lonely are the free 
<br/>
