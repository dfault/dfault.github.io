<h3>Land Down Under</h3>
<h4>Men at Work</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  Traveling in a fried-out combie
<br/>
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
<br/>
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
<br/>
She took me in and gave me breakfast
<br/>
And she said,
<br/>

<br/>
``Do you come from a land down under?
<br/>
Where women glow and men plunder?
<br/>
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
<br/>
You better run, you better take cover.''
<br/>

<br/>
Buying bread from a man in Brussels
<br/>
He was six foot four and full of muscles
<br/>
I said, ``Do you speak-a my language?''
<br/>
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
<br/>
And he said,
<br/>

<br/>
``I come from a land down under
<br/>
Where beer does flow and men chunder
<br/>
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
<br/>
You better run, you better take cover.''
<br/>

<br/>
Lying in a den in Bombay
<br/>
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
<br/>
I said to the man, ``Are you trying to tempt me
<br/>
Because I come from the land of plenty?''
<br/>
And he said,
<br/>

<br/>
``Oh! Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)
<br/>
Where women glow and men plunder?
<br/>
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
<br/>
You better run, you better take cover.''
