<h3>Comes a time</h3>
<h4>Neil Young</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  C<span>G</span>omes a time, Wh<span>Bm</span>en your driftin’ <span>D</span>\\
<br/>
Comes a time, When you settle d<span>Am7</span>own <span>C</span>\\
<br/>

<br/>
C<span>G</span>omes a light F<span>Bm</span>eelin’s liftin’ <span>D</span>\\
<br/>
Lift that baby right up o<span>Am7</span>ff the ground <span>C</span>\\
<br/>

<br/>
O<span>G</span>h, th<span>F</span>is old wor<span>C</span>ld keeps sp<span>G</span>innin’ ‘round 
<br/>
It’s a w<span>F</span>onder tall tr<span>C</span>ees ain’t l<span>G</span>aying down
<br/>
There comes a t<span>Dm7</span>ime
<br/>

<br/>
Y<span>G</span>ou and I, W<span>Bm</span>e were captured <span>D</span>\\
<br/>
We took our souls, And we flew <span>Am7</span>away <span>C</span>\\
<br/>

<br/>
W<span>G</span>e were right W<span>Bm</span>e were giving <span>D</span>\\
<br/>
That’s how we kept what w<span>Am7</span>e gave awa<span>C</span>y\\
<br/>

<br/>
O<span>G</span>h, th<span>F</span>is old wor<span>C</span>ld keeps sp<span>G</span>innin’ ‘round 
<br/>
It’s a w<span>F</span>onder tall tr<span>C</span>ees ain’t l<span>G</span>aying down
<br/>
There comes a t<span>Dm7</span>ime
