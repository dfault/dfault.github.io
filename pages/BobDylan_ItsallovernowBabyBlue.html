<h3>It's all over now, Baby Blue</h3>
<h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>G</span>You must leave now, take what you need, you <span>F</span>think will <span>C</span>last
<br/>
But what<span>G</span>ever you wish to keep, you better <span>F</span>grab it <span>C</span>fast
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>Yonder stands your <span>F</span>orphan with his <span>C</span>gun
<br/>
<span>Dm</span>Crying like a <span>F</span>fire in the <span>C</span>sun
<br/>
<span>E</span>Look out the saints <span>F</span>are com<span>G</span>ing through
<br/>
And <span>Dm</span>it's all over <span>F</span>now, Baby <span>C</span>Blue.
<br/>

<br/>
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
<br/>
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
<br/>
The empty-handed painter from your streets
<br/>
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
<br/>
This sky, too, is folding under you
<br/>
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
<br/>

<br/>
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
<br/>
Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
<br/>
The lover who just walked out your door
<br/>
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
<br/>
The carpet, too, is moving under you
<br/>
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
<br/>

<br/>
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
<br/>
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
<br/>
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
<br/>
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
<br/>
Strike another match, go start anew
<br/>
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
