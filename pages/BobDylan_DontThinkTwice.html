<h3>Don't Think Twice</h3>
<h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  It a<span>C</span>in't no use to s<span>G</span>it and wonder w<span>Am</span>hy, babe 
<br/>
I<span>F</span>f you don't know by <span>C</span>no<span>G</span>w 
<br/>
An' it a<span>C</span>in't no use to s<span>G</span>it and wonder w<span>Am</span>hy, babe 
<br/>
<span>D7</span>It'll never do someh<span>G</span>ow 
<br/>
When your r<span>C</span>ooster crows at the b<span>C7</span>reak of dawn 
<br/>
L<span>F</span>ook out your window and I'l<span>D7</span>l be gone 
<br/>
Y<span>C</span>ou're the r<span>G</span>eason I'm t<span>Am</span>rav'lin' o<span>F</span>n 
<br/>
D<span>C</span>on't think t<span>G</span>wice, it's all r<span>C</span>ight 
<br/>

<br/>
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
<br/>
That light I never knowed
<br/>
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
<br/>
I'm on the dark side of the road
<br/>
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
<br/>
To try and make me change my mind and stay
<br/>
We never did too much talkin' anyway
<br/>
Don't think twice,it's all right
<br/>

<br/>
It ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
<br/>
Like you never did before
<br/>
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
<br/>
I can't hear you anymore
<br/>
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' all the way down the road
<br/>
I once loved aw woman,a child I'm told
<br/>
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
<br/>
Don't think twice,it's all right
<br/>

<br/>
So loooooong, honey babe
<br/>
Where I'm bound,I can't tell
<br/>
But goodbye's too good a word,babe
<br/>
So I'll just say fare thee well
<br/>
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
<br/>
You could have done better but I don't mind
<br/>
You just kinda wasted my precious time
<br/>
But don't think twice,it's all right
