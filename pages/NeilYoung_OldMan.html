<br/>
Lullabies, look in your eyes,
<br/>
Run around the same old town.

Doesn't mean that much to me 
<br/>
To mean that much to you
<br/>
I've been first and last
<br/>
Look at how the time goes past.
<br/>
But I'm all alone at last.
<br/>
Rolling home to you.
<br/>

Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you were &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x2
