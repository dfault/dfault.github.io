<h3>The Mercy Seat</h3>
<h4>Johnny Cash</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
    \begin{multicols}{2}
<br/>

<br/>
It all began when they took me from my home
<br/>
And put me on Death Row,
<br/>
a crime for which I am totally innocent, you know.
<br/>

<br/>
I began to warm and chill
<br/>
To objects and their fields,
<br/>
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
<br/>
The face of Jesus in my soup
<br/>
Those sinister dinner deals
<br/>
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
<br/>
A hooked bone rising from my food
<br/>
All things either good or ungood.
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>And the mercy seat is waiting
<br/>
<span>Am#7</span>And I think my head is burning
<br/>
<span>Am7</span>And in a way I'm yearning
<br/>
To be <span>G</span>done with all this weighing of the <span>Gm</span>truth.
<br/>
An eye for an eye
<br/>
And a tooth for a <span>bB</span>tooth
<br/>
And anyway I told the <span>F</span>truth
<br/>
And I'm not afraid to <span>Am</span>die.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>I hear stories from the <span>Am#7</span>chamber
<br/>
Christ was born into a <span>Am7</span>manger
<br/>
And like some ragged stranger
<br/>
He <span>G</span>died upon the cross
<br/>
Might I <span>Gm</span>say, it seems so fitting in its <span>bB</span>way
<br/>
He was a carpenter by <span>F</span>trade
<br/>
Or at least that's what I'm <span>Am</span>told
<br/>

<br/>
{\scriptsize Am \hspace{0.5cm} Em \hspace{0,5cm} Am \hspace{0.5cm} Em \hspace{0,5cm}}
<br/>

<br/>
My kill-hand's
<br/>
tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
<br/>
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Am</span>In Heaven His throne is made of <span>Am#7</span>gold
<br/>
The ark of his Testament is <span>Am7</span>stowed
<br/>
A throne from which I'm told
<br/>
All <span>G</span>history does unfold.
<br/>
It's <span>Gm</span>made of wood and wire
<br/>
And my <span>bB</span>body is on fire
<br/>
<span>F</span>And God is never far <span>Am</span>away.
<br/>

<br/>
Into the mercy seat I climb
<br/>
My head is shaved, my head is wired
<br/>
And like a moth that tries
<br/>
To enter the bright eye
<br/>
I go shuffling out of life
<br/>
Just to hide in death awhile
<br/>
And anyway I never lied.
<br/>

<br/>
And the mercy seat is waiting
<br/>
And I think my head is burning
<br/>
And in a way I'm yearning
<br/>
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
<br/>
An eye for an eye
<br/>
And a tooth for a tooth
<br/>
And anyway I told the truth
<br/>
And I'm not afraid to die
<br/>

<br/>
And the mercy seat is burning
<br/>
And I think my head is glowing
<br/>
And in a way I'm hopin'
<br/>
to be done with all this twistin' of the truth.
<br/>
An eye for an eye
<br/>
And a tooth for a tooth
<br/>
And any way there was no proof
<br/>
And I'm not afraid to die
<br/>

<br/>
And the mercy seat is glowing
<br/>
And I think my head is smoking
<br/>
And in a way I'm hopin'
<br/>
to be done with all these looks of disbelief.
<br/>
A life for a life
<br/>
And a truth for a truth
<br/>
And I've got nothin' left to loose.
<br/>
And I'm not afraid to die
<br/>

<br/>
And the mercy seat is smoking
<br/>
And I think my head is melting
<br/>
And in a way that's helpin'
<br/>
to be done with all this twistin' of the truth
<br/>
An eye for an eye
<br/>
And a tooth for a tooth
<br/>
And any way I told the truth
<br/>
But I'm afraid I told a lie.
