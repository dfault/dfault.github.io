<span class="chord">C</span>Holly came from Miami, <span class="chord">Fmaj7</span>FLA
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Hitch-hiked her way across the <span class="chord">Fmaj7</span>USA
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">C</span>Plucked her eyebrows <span class="chord">D</span>on the way
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="chord">F</span>Shaved her legs and then <span class="chord">D</span>he was a she
<br/>
<br/>
She says, <span class="chord">C</span>Hey babe,
<br/>
<br/>
Take a <span class="chord">Fmaj7</span>walk on the wild side.
<br/>
<br/>
She said, <span class="chord">C</span>Hey honey,

Take a walk on the <span class="chord">Fmaj7</span>wild side.

<br/>
Candy came from out on the Island
<br/>
In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'
<br/>
But she never lost her head
<br/>
Even when she was giving head
<br/>
She says, Hey babe,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
Said, Hey babe,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
And the colored girls go:
<br/>
Doo do doo do doo do do doo, ...
<br/>

<br/>
Little Joe never once gave it away
<br/>
Everybody had to pay and pay
<br/>
A hustle here and a hustle there
<br/>
New York City's the place where they said, Hey babe,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
I said, Hey Joe,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>

<br/>
Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
<br/>
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
<br/>
Went to the Apollo
<br/>
You should've seen 'em go, go, go
<br/>
They said, Hey sugar,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
I said, Hey babe,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
All right, huh
<br/>

<br/>
Jackie is just speeding away
<br/>
Thought she was James Dean for a day
<br/>
Then I guess she had to crash
<br/>
Valium would have helped that bash
<br/>
She said, Hey babe,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
I said, Hey honey,
<br/>
Take a walk on the wild side.
<br/>
And the colored girls say:
<br/>
Doo do doo do doo do do doo....
