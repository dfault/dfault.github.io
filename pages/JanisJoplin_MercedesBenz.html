<h3>Mercedes Benz</h3>
<h4>Janis Joplin</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  O<span>D</span>h Lord, won't you buy me a M<span>G</span>ercedes B<span>D</span>enz?
<br/>
My friends all drive Porsches, and <span>A7</span>I must make amends.
<br/>
W<span>D</span>orked hard all my lifetime, no h<span>G</span>elp for my fr<span>D</span>iends,
<br/>
So oh! Lord, won't you buy me a M<span>A7</span>ercedes B<span>D</span>enz?
<br/>

<br/>
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
<br/>
``Dialing for dollars`` is trying to find me,
<br/>
I wait for delivery each day until three,
<br/>
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
<br/>

<br/>
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
<br/>
I'm counting on you, lord, please don't let me down.
<br/>
Prove that you love me and buy the next round,
<br/>
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
<br/>

<br/>
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
<br/>
My friends all drive Porsches, and I must make amends.
<br/>
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help for my friends,
<br/>
So oh! Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
