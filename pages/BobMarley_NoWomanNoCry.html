<br/>

<br/>
No, woman, no cry;

<br/>
<span>C</span>I re<span>G</span>member <span>Am</span>when we used to <span>F</span>sit
<br/>
In the government yard in trenchtown,
<br/>
Oba - obaserving the ypocrites
<br/>
As they would mingle with the good people we met
<br/>
Good friends we had, good friends weve lost
<br/>
Along the way
<br/>
In this great future, you cant forget your past
<br/>
So dry your tears, I say
<br/>

<br/>
<span>C</span>No, <span>G</span>woman, no <span>Am</span>cry <span>F</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
<span>C</span>No, <span>G</span>woman, no <span>C</span>cry <span>G</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>
<span>C</span>Ah <span>G</span>little darlin, <span>Am</span>dont shed no <span>F</span>tears
<br/>
<span>C</span>No, <span>G</span>woman, no <span>C</span>cry <span>G</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>

<br/>
I remember when-a we used to sit
<br/>
In the government yard in trenchtown
<br/>
And then georgie would make the fire lights
<br/>
As it was logwood burnin through the nights
<br/>
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
<br/>
Of which Ill share with you
<br/>
My feet is my only carriag
<br/>
So Ive got to push on through.
<br/>
But while Im gone, I mean:
<br/>

<br/>
Everythings gonna be all right!
<br/>

<br/>
So, woman, no cry;
<br/>
No - no, woman - woman, no cry
<br/>
Woman, little sister, dont shed no tears
<br/>
No, woman, no cry
