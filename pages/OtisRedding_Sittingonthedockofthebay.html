<h3>Sitting on the dock of the bay</h3>
<h4>Otis Redding</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>G</span>Sitting in the morning <span>B7</span>sun I'll be <span>C</span>sitting when the evening <span>A</span>comes
<br/>
<span>G</span>watching the ships roll <span>B7</span>in and I'll <span>C</span>watch 'em roll away <span>A</span>again yea
<br/>
I'm <span>G</span>sitting on the dock of the <span>E</span>bay watching the <span>G</span>tide roll <span>E</span>away ooh
<br/>
I'm just <span>G</span>sitting on the dock of the <span>A</span>bay wasting <span>G</span>time <span>E</span> $&nbsp;&nbsp;$
<br/>

<br/>
I left my home in Georgia headed for the Frisco bay
<br/>
'cause I've had nothing to live for
<br/>
and look like nothing's gonna come my way
<br/>

<br/>
So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay watching the tide roll away ooh
<br/>
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time
<br/>

<br/>
<span>G</span>Looks <span>D</span>like <span>C</span>nothing's gonna change <span>G</span>everyth<span>D</span>ing still rem<span>C</span>ains the same
<br/>
<span>G</span>I can't <span>D</span>do what <span>C</span>ten people tell me to do <span>F</span>so I guess I'll rem<span>D</span>ain the same yes
<br/>

<br/>
Sitting here resting my bones and this loneliness won't leave me alone
<br/>
two thousand miles I roam just to make this dock my home
<br/>
now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay watching the tide roll away ooh
<br/>
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time
