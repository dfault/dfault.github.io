<span class="chord">G</span>They say <span class="chord">A</span>love <span class="chord">G</span>is bl<span class="chord">H</span>ind

<br/>
But I don't see <span class="chord">A</span>it
<br/>
Won't get you off my mind
<br/>
You're firmly in it's grip
<br/>
Iceberg's find pleasure ships
<br/>
Their sides ripped wide
<br/>
Hearts shudder and quit
<br/>
They break and die
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
You're making tracks and I'm losing ground
<br/>

<br/>
Captain of the ship
<br/>
That's going down
<br/>
Waters close to sip
<br/>
Hang on and drown
<br/>
Life is precious
<br/>
In the light of fear
<br/>
Love is vicious
<br/>
As a pool of tears
<br/>

<br/>
You're making tracks and I'm losing ground
<br/>

<br/>
They say love is blind
<br/>
But I don't see it
<br/>
Won't get you off my mind
<br/>
You're firmly in it's grip
<br/>

<br/>
Wading in shallow water
<br/>
You were meant to swim
<br/>
One of Venus' daughters
<br/>
Love is a whim
<br/>

<br/>
You're making tracks and I'm losing ground
<br/>
