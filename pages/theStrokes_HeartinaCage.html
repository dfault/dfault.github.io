<h4>the Strokes</h4>
<p class="song show-chords">
  <span>Cm</span>I don't feel better when <span>Ab</span>I'm fucking <span>Eb</span>around
<br/>
And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
<br/>
So don't teach me a lesson cause I've already learned
<br/>
Yeah the sun will be shining and my children will burn
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Cm</span>Oh the Hea<span>Ab</span>rt Beats in its c<span>Eb</span>age
<br/>

<br/>
I don't want what you want I don't feel what you feel
<br/>
See I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
<br/>
Yeah we got left, left, left, left, left, left
<br/>
Now it's 3 in the morning and your eating alone
<br/>

<br/>
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
<br/>

<br/>
<span>Cm</span>All our Friends, th<span>F</span>ey're laughing at <span>Bb</span>us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>A</span>
<br/>
All of those you love you mistrust
<br/>
Help me I'm just not quite myself
<br/>
Look around theres no-one else left
<br/>

<br/>
I went to the concert and I fought throught the crowd
<br/>
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
<br/>
Yeah he got left, left, left, left, left, left
<br/>
I'm sorry you were thinking, I would steal your fire
<br/>

<br/>
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
<br/>
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
<br/>
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
