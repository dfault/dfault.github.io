Once I Had A Girlfriend, 
<br/>
She Meant The World To Me 
<br/>
She Went Down To Deep Elem, 
<br/>
Now She Ain't What She Used To Be 
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
Once I Knew A Preacher, 
<br/>
Preached The Bible Through And Through 
<br/>
He went down to Deep Elem, 
<br/>
Now His Preaching Days Are Through 
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
When You Go Down To Deep Elem 
<br/>
To Have A Little Fun, 
<br/>
Have Your Ten Dollars Ready 
<br/>
When The Police Man Comes 
<br/>
 
<br/>

<br/>
When you go down to Deep Elem 
<br/>
Put your money in your pants 
<br/>
Cause the women in Deep Elem 
<br/>
They don't give a man a chance
