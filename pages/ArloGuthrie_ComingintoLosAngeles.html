<h4>Arlo Guthrie</h4>

<br/>
Fl<span>F</span>yin' in a b<span>C</span>ig airl<span>E-E7</span>iner
<br/>
Chickens flyin' everywhere around the plane
<br/>
Could we ever feel much finer?
<br/>

<br/>
C<span>Am</span>omin' into L<span>Am/G</span>os Angel<span>D</span>es

<br/>

<br/>
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico
<br/>
No, he couldn't look much stranger
<br/>
Walkin' in the hall with his things and all
<br/>
Smilin, said he was the lone ranger
<br/>

<br/>
Comin' into Los Angeles
<br/>
Bringin' in a couple of keys
<br/>
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
<br/>

<br/>
Hip woman walkin' on the movin' floor
<br/>
Trippin' on the escalator
<br/>
There's a man in the line and she's blowin' his mind
<br/>
Thinkin' that he's already made her
<br/>

<br/>
Comin' into Los Angeles
<br/>
Bringin' in a couple of keys
<br/>
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
