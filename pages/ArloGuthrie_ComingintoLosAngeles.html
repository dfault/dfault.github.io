<br/>
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico
<br/>
No, he couldn't look much stranger
<br/>
Walkin' in the hall with his things and all
<br/>
Smilin, said he was the lone ranger
<br/>

<br/>
Comin' into Los Angeles
<br/>
Bringin' in a couple of keys
<br/>
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
<br/>

<br/>
Hip woman walkin' on the movin' floor
<br/>
Trippin' on the escalator
<br/>
There's a man in the line and she's blowin' his mind
<br/>
Thinkin' that he's already made her
<br/>

<br/>
Comin' into Los Angeles
<br/>
Bringin' in a couple of keys
<br/>
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
