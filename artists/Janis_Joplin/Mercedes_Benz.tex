O[D]h Lord, won't you buy me a M[G]ercedes B[D]enz?
My friends all drive Porsches, and [A7]I must make amends.
W[D]orked hard all my lifetime, no h[G]elp for my fr[D]iends,
So oh! Lord, won't you buy me a M[A7]ercedes B[D]enz?



Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
``Dialing for dollars`` is trying to find me,
I wait for delivery each day until three,
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?



Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
I'm counting on you, lord, please don't let me down.
Prove that you love me and buy the next round,
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?



Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
My friends all drive Porsches, and I must make amends.
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help for my friends,
So oh! Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
