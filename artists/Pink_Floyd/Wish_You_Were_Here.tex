\begin{guitar}
S[C]o, so you think you can t[D]ell,
Heaven from H[Am]ell, blue skies from p[G]ain.
Can you tell a green f[D]ield from a cold steel r[C]ail, a smile from a v[Am]eil,
Do you think you can t[G]ell?



And did they get you to tr[C]ade your heroes for gh[D]osts,
Hot ashes for t[Am]rees, hot air for a cool b[G]reeze, cold comfort for ch[D]ange,
And did you exch[C]ange a walk on part in the w[Am]ar for a lead role in a c[G]age?



\chords{Em|G|Em|G|Em|A|Em|A|G}



H[C]ow I wish, how I wish you were h[D]ere.
We're just tw[Am]o lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, y[G]ear after yea[D]r,
Running over the same old ground. Wh[C]at have we found?
The same old f[Am]ears. Wish you were her[G]e!
