\begin{guitar}
[Cm]I don't feel better when [Ab]I'm fucking [Eb]around
And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson cause I've already learned
Yeah the sun will be shining and my children will burn



[Cm]Oh the Hea[Ab]rt Beats in its c[Eb]age



I don't want what you want I don't feel what you feel
See I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
Yeah we got left, left, left, left, left, left
Now it's 3 in the morning and your eating alone



Oh the Heart Beats in its cage



[Cm]All our Friends, th[F]ey're laughing at [Bb]us\quad[A]{}
All of those you love you mistrust
Help me I'm just not quite myself
Look around theres no-one else left



I went to the concert and I fought throught the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
Yeah he got left, left, left, left, left, left
I'm sorry you were thinking, I would steal your fire



Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
Oh the Heart Beats in its cage



\chords{Cm x8}



Oh the Heart Beats in its cage
