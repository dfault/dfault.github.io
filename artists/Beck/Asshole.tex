\begin{guitar}
\chords{C|E|A} 
Your brains went black when she took back her love 
and put it out into the sun 
The birds did fly when the heavens all went dry 
And the cigarettes are smokin by themselves 



S[F]he'll do anything 
S[E]he'll do anything 
S[A]he'll do anyth[C]ing to make you feel like an asshole 



Call her name, she looks the same as you 
question mark stretched across the skin 
She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarrassed 
to be the fool you know you are 
\end{guitar}
