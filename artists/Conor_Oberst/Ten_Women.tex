Ten w[A]omen (ten women)
Ten women
Between you and m[D]e
Ten w[A]omen (ten women)
Ten women
The nightmare and the [Bm]fantas[D]y
Ten w[F#m]omen
The thrill and the sh[E]ame
Ten w[A]omen
I miss you the s[D]ame
While you're k[Bm]issing the r[E]ing
Of some g[A]ood timing k[D]ing
Ten w[Bm]omen
A f[E]ool I have m[A]ade

Two f[A]aces (two faces)
Two faces
Two faces you h[D]ave
Two f[A]aces (two faces)
Two faces
Keep one i[Bm]n your b[D]ack
Two f[F#m]aces
From which you can ch[E]oose
Two f[A]aces
And neither one y[D]ou
Well [Bm]I'm biding my t[E]ime
Like a c[A]ellar of w[D]ine
Two f[Bm]aces
You'll n[E]ever ref[A]ute

One w[A]itness (one witness)
One witness
Is all that I n[D]eed
One w[A]itness (one witness)
One witness
Just someone to s[Bm,D]ee
One w[F#m]itness
To all that's been d[E]one
One w[A]itness
Whose eyes will not r[D]un
Just s[Bm]omeone to sh[E]out
In this b[A]ig, empty h[D]ouse
One w[Bm]itness
To m[E]ourn for our l[A]ove

Ten w[A]omen (ten women)
Ten women
Between you and m[D]e
Ten w[A]omen (ten women)
Ten women
The glory and the tr[Bm]aged[D]y
Ten w[F#m]omen
To trust and betr[E]ay
Ten w[A]omen
I want you the s[D]ame
It will b[Bm]e like it's b[E]een
If you c[A]ome home ag[D]ain
With ten w[Bm]omen
Wh[E]o have all gone aw[A]ay
