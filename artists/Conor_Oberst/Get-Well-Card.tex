\begin{guitar}
A p[G]eacock, people left the p[Bm]lumes in a pile
T[C]hey look good to f[Em]old
And the G[G]ulf water's warm l[Bm]ike a bathtub
F[C]ull of lavender and epsom s[D]alt



See a b[G]leach blond boy put his [Bm]longboard down
H[C]elp his girl get her sunscreen o[Em]n
I t[G]hought about you in your l[Bm]ittle house
Think you're l[C]onely but I could be w[D]rong and\ldots



[C]I wanna be a b[D]ootlegger
W[C]anna mix you up something s[D]trange
B[C]raid your hair like a s[D]ister
M[C]aim you like a hurric[D]ane



R[G]ight there, that's the p[D]ostman s[C]leeping in the s[Em]and
H[G]e's got a letter to del[D]iver, but I c[C]an't stay m[D]ad
R[G]ight there, that's the p[D]ostman s[C]leeping in the s[Em]and
He's got a g[G]et-well-card to del[D]iver
He's gonna d[C]o it by h[D]and, he's gonna d[C]o it by h[D]and



Now they drive the cars up and down the beach
It's ridiculous and everybody knows
Hear the Mustangs rev at the four way stop
You get ghosted when the light says go
But in a town like this, in the chequered flag dawn
It's so empty you could make somebody dream
So maybe it's you, in your four-post bed
Found asleep with still blood in your teeth and\ldots



I wanna be your happiness
I wanna be your common sense pain
Wrap your head in a picket fence
Rebuild after the hurricane



Right there, that's the postman sleeping in the sand
He's got a letter to deliver, but i'm still not mad
Right there, that's the postman sleeping in the sand
He's got a get-well-card to deliver
He's gonna do it by hand,
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it,
He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it\ldots by hand
