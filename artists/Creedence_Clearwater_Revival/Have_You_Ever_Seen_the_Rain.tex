\begin{guitar}
S[C]omeone told me long ago
T[C]here's a calm before the storm, I k[G]now
And it's been coming f[C]or some time



When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
Shining down like water



I[F]{} wa[G]nna know
Have you e[C]ver s[C/B]een the r[Am]ain[C/G]{}
I[F]{} wa[G]nna know
Have you e[C]ver s[C/B]een the r[Am]ain[C/G]{}
C[F]oming d[G]own on a sunny d[C]ay



Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
Been that way for all my time



'Til forever on it goes
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
And it can't stop, I wonder



I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day



I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day
