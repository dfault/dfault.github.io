[G]Where do bad folks [F]go when they [H]die
[G]They don't go to heaven where the [C]angels [H]fly
[G]Go to a lake of [F]fire and [H]fry
[C]see them again 't[F]ill the Fourth of [G]July


\chords{G|F|G|(x2)}


[Dm]I knew a lady who [H]came from Duluth
[Dm]Bitten by a dog with a [A]rabid tooth
[Dm]She went to her grave just a [H]little too soon
[C]Flew and lay down on the [Dm]yellow moon

Where do bad folks go when they die
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
see them again 'till the Fourth of July


\chords{G|F|G|(x2)}


People cry and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

Where do bad folks go when they die
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry
see them again 'till the Fourth of July


\chords{G|F|G|(x2)}
