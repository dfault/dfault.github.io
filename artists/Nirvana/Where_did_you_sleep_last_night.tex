[Em]My girl, my girl, don't [A]lie to [G]me
Tell me [B]where did you sleep last [Em]night
[Em]In the pines, in the pines
Where the [A]sun don't ever sh[G]ine
I would [B]shiver the whole n[Em]ight through


My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through


Her husband, was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel 
But his body never was found


My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through


My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through


My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through


My girl, my girl, where will ya go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines
The sun, the shine
I'll shiver the whole night through
