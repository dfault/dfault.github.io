\begin{guitar}
I[C]t's warm by the river, the weir keeps us clean
The w[F4]oodsmoke and cigarettes are all that we n[C]eed
M[C]arking the dirt with twigs and simple words spoke
Kick[F4]ing the dust so we can just..



D[C]ance the dance that plays with fire
We pl[Bb]ay guitar and we play it insp[C]ired
Y[C]ou said you would leave not ever
U[Bb]nderneath the sky for[C]ever


			    
It's cool by the sea when the pavement is hot
We take a walk down there to see what we've got
An old man collecting fifty beautiful words
Cleaning the beach so he can teach us to
			        


CHORUS



It's cold by the pane glass on the high street we played
But there's always a penny in the music we made
So far from home with no means of return
Burning bridges, so we always



CHORUS



W[G]e're so far from home
No ne[Dm]ed to return
Th[Bb]ere's so much that we have taught 
And s[C]o much that we have learned
