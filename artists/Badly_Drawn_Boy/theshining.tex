\chords{E|Amaj7}

[E]Faith pours from your [Amaj7]walls, drowning your [E]calls
I've tried to [Amaj7]hear, you're not [E]near [Amaj7] 


\chords{E|Amaj7}

Remembering when I saw your face
Shining my way, pure timing
Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep
It's killing me, I'm dying


To [B]put a little bit of [A]sunshine in your [E]life


[E]Soleil [A]all over [E]you, warm sun [A]pours over [E]me
Soleil [A]all over [E]you
Warm sun [A] $\quad$


Now this slick fallen rift came like a gift
Your body moves ever nearer
And you will dry this tear
Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history
But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain
Then it's replaced, sun setting


And [B]suddenly you're in [A]love with every[E]thing

\chords{E|Amaj7}

[E]Soleil [A]all over [E]you, warm sun [A]pours over [E]me
Soleil [A]all over [E]you
Warm sun [A] $\quad$
