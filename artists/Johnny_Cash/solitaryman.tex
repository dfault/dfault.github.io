\begin{guitar}

[Em]Belinda was [Am]mine 'til the [G]time that I [Em]found her
[G]Holdin' [Am]Jim
[G]And lovin' [Am]him
[Em]Then Sue came [Am]along, loved me [G]strong, that's what [Em]I thought
[G]But me and [Am]Sue,
[G]That died, [Am]too.


[G]Don't know that I [C]will but [G]until I can [D]find me
A girl who'll [C]stay and won't [G]play games beh[D]ind me
I'll be what I [Em]am
[D]A solitary [Em]man
[D]A solitary [Em]man


I've had it here - being where love's a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done havin' one girl who loves you
Right or wrong
Weak or strong
\end{guitar}
