\begin{guitar}
[A]Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I [G]left Tennessee very much alive
I nev[A]er would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on the [E]Tennessee [A]Stud



H[A]ad some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
[G]One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
[A]I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the [E]Tennessee [A]Stud



The [A]Tennessee Stud was [G]long and [A]lean
The [D]color of the sun and his [C]eyes were [E]green
[A]He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like [E]Tennessee [A]Stud



Drifted on down into no man's land
Across the river called the Rio Grande
Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold



Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud



The [A]Tennessee Stud was [G]long and [A]lean
The [D]color of the sun and his [C]eyes were [E]green
[A]He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like [E]Tennessee [A]Stud



I rode right back across Arkansas
I whupped her brother and I whupped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare



Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare



The [A]Tennessee Stud was [G]long and [A]lean
The [D]color of the sun and his [C]eyes were [E]green
[A]He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like [E]Tennessee [A]Stud
