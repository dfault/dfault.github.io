\begin{guitar}

\chords{A|D|A|D}

Well I [F#m]won't [E]back [A]down, no I [F#m]won't [E]back [A]down
You can [F#m]stand me [E]up at the [D]gates of hell
But I [F#m]won't [E]back [A]down


Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down


[D]Hey [E]baby, [D]there ain't no easy way [E]out
[D]Hey [E]I will [F#m]stand [E]my [A]ground and I [F#m]won't [E]back [E]down


Well I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I stand my ground and I won't back down

Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down
No I won't back down.
