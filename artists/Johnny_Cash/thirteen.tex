\chords{Am}

[Am]Bad luck wind been [D]blowing at my [Am]back
I was [D]born to bring trouble to [C]wherever I'm [Am]at 
Got the [Am]number thirteen [D]tattooed on my [Am]neck
When the [D]ink starts to itch, then the [C]black will turn to [Am]red


I was [D]born in the soul of [Am]misery
[D]Never had me a [Am]name
[D]They just gave me the [C]number when [G]I was [Am]young


Got a long line of heartache
I carry it well
The list of lives
I've broken reach from here to hell
Back luck been blowing at my back
I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back

I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young

I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young
They just gave me the number when I was young
