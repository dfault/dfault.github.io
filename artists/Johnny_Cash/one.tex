[Am]Is it getting [D]better
[F]Or do you feel the [G]same
[Am]Will it make it [D]easier on you now
[F]If youve got someone to [G]blame


You said [C]one love
[Am]One life
When its [F]one need
[C]In the night
[C]One love we get to [Am]share it
It [F]leaves you baby if you dont [C]care for it


Did i disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without


Well its too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgivness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play jesus
To the lepors in your head

Did i ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing now
Its all i got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other and we're doin it again

\columnbreak

You said [C]love is a temple
[Am]Love the higher law
[C]Love is a temple
[Am]Love the higher law
[C]You ask me to enter
But [G]then you make me crawl
I cant be holdin on
[F]To what youve got
When all youve got is hurt


[C]One love
[Am]One blood
[F]One life
Youve got to [C]do what you should
One life with each other
Sister
Brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One
