\begin{guitar}
\chords{Am}

From the [Am]hands it came down
From the [Dm]side it came down
From the [E]feet it came down
And [Am]ran to the ground
Between [Am]heaven and hell
A [Dm]teardrop fell
In the [E]deep crimson dew
The [Am]tree of life grew


And the [C]blood gave life
To the [G]branches of the tree
And the [F]blood was the price
That [G]set the captives free
And the [C]numbers that came
Through the [G]fire and the flood 
[F]Clung to the tree
And were red[Am]eemed by the blood


From the tree streamed a light
That started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine
On whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came
Fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks
Of six-sixty-six

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set the captives free
And the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood 
Clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From his hands it came down
From his side it came down
From his feet it came down
And ran to the ground
And a small inner voice
Said You do have a choice
The vine engrafted me
And I clung to the tree
