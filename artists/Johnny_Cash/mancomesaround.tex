\begin{guitar}
There's a [C]man going around taking names and he decides
Who to free and who to blame every body won't be treated
Quite the same there will be a golden ladder reaching [Am]down
[F]When the [G]man comes [C]around

The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each
Sip and each sup will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around


[C]Hear the trumpets hear the pipers one hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to a [F]big kettle[G]drum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
Its alpha and omegas kingdom [C]come
And the [F]whirlwind is in the [C]thorn trees
The [C]virgins are all trimming their wicks
The [F]whirlwind is in the [C]thorn trees
It's [C]hard for thee to kick against the pricks

[C]Till Armageddon no shalom no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chicken's home
The wise man will bow down before the thorn and at his feet
They will cast the golden [Am]crowns
[F]When the [G]man comes [C]around

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around
