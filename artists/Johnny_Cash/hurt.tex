\chords{Am}

I [C]hurt my[D]self [Am]today
To [C]see if [D]I still [Am]feel
I [C]focus [D]on the [Am]pain
The [C]only [D]thing that's [Am]real
The [C]needle [D]tears a [Am]hole
The [C]old fa[D]miliar [Am]sting
Try to [C]kill it [D]all [Am]away
But I [C]remember [D]every[G]thing


[Am]What have I be[F]come
[C]My sweetest [G]friend
[Am]Everyone I [F]know goes [C]away
In the [G]end
And [Am]you could have it [F]all
[G]My empire of dirt
[Am]I will let you [F]down
[G]I will make you [Am]hurt


I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here


What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt


[Am]If I could start [F]again
A [G]million miles away
[Am]I would keep my[F]self
[G]I would find a [Am]way
