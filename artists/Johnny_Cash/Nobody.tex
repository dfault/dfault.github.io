\begin{guitar}
[D]When life seems full of clouds and rain
[G]And I'm full of nothin' but pain
[A]Who soothes my thumpin', bumpin' brain?
[D]Nobody

When Wintertime comes with its snow and sleet
And me with hunger and cold feet
Who says ``Here's two bits, go and eat''?
Nobody

[A]Well,I ain't never done nothin' to 
[D]nobody
[A]I ain't never got nothin' from 
[D]nobody, no time
[A]And until I get something from 
[D]somebody, sometime
[D]I don't intend to [G]do nothin' for
[E]nobod[A]y, no t[D]ime

When Summertime comes all warm and clear
And my friends see me drawin' near
Who says ``come on in and have a beer''?
Nobody

Well one time when things was lookin' bright
I started to whittlin' on a stick one night
Who said ``Hey! That's dynamite!''?
Nobody

Mmmm, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time
