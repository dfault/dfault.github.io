\begin{guitar}

I [A]found him by the [E]railroad track this [A]morning
[A]I could see that [E]he was nearly [A]dead
[D]I knelt down beside him and I [A]listened
Just to [E]hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they [A]let me out of [E]prison down in [A]Frisco
For [A]ten long years I've [E]paid for what I've [A]done
I was [D]trying to get back to [A]Louisiana
To [E]see my Rose and get to know my [A]son


[D]Give my love to Rose please won't you [A]mister
[E]Take her all my money, tell her to [A]buy some pretty clothes
[D]Tell my boy his daddy's so proud [A]of him
And [E]don't forget to give my love to [A]Rose


Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
