\begin{guitar}

[G]Love is a [C]burning [G]thing
and it [G]makes a [C]firery [G]ring
[G]bound by [C]wild [G]desire
[G]I fell in to a [C]ring of [G]fire...


[D]I fell in to a [C]burning ring of [G]fire
I went [D]down,down,down
and the [C]flames went [G]higher.
And it [G]burns,burns,burns
[C]the ring of [G]fire
[D]the ring of [G]fire.


The taste of love is sweet
when hearts like our's meet
I fell for you like a child
oh, but the fire went wild..

I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down,down,down
and the flames went higher.
And it burns,burns,burns
the ring of fire
the ring of fire.

\end{guitar}
