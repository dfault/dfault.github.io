\begin{guitar}
[D7]come on all of you big strong men
[G]Uncle Sam needs your help again
he's [D7]got himself in a terrible jam
[G]way down yonder in Viet Nam so
[E7]put down your books and p[A7]ick up a gun we're
[D7]gonna have a whole lotta f[G]un



And it's [D/E]one, [D/F]two, [D/F#]three, what are we [G]fighting for
don't ask me I [D7]don't give a damn, next stop is [G]Viet Nam
And it's [D/E]five, [D/F]six, [D/F#]seven, open up the [G]pearly gates
[E7]ain't no time to [A7]wonder why, [D7]whoopee we're all gonna [G]die



come on generals, let's move fast
your big chance has come at last
now you can go out and get those reds
cos the only good commie is the one that's dead and
you know that peace can only be won when we've
blown 'em all to kingdom come



come on wall street don't be slow
why man this war is a go-go
there's plenty good money to be made by
supplying the army with the tools of its trade
let's hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,
they drop it on the Viet Cong



come on mothers throughout the land
pack your boys off to Viet Nam
come on fathers don't hesitate
send your sons off before it's too late
and you can be the first ones on your block
to have your boy come home in a box
