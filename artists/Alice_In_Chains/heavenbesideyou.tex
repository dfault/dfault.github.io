\begin{guitar}

Be what you wanna be
See what you came to see
Been what you wanna be
I dont like what I see

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you... hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you... hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you... hell within
And you think you have it still, heaven inside you

So theres problems in your life
Thats fucked up, and Im not blind
Im just see through faded, super jaded
And out of my mind

Do what you wanna do
Go out and seek your truth
When Im down and blue
Rather be me than you

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you... hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you... hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you... hell within
And you wish you had it still, heaven inside you

So theres problems in your life
Thats fucked up, and Im not blind
Im just see through faded, super jaded
And out of my mind

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you... hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you... hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you... hell within
And you know you have it still, heaven inside you

So theres problems in your life
Thats fucked up, but youre not blind
Youre just see through faded, overrated
And out of your mind
