Yeah
It goes away.
All of this and more of no-thing in my life.
No
Color clay.
Indi-vidu-ali-ty not safe.



\chords{D|F|C\#|A|G\#|E|F\#|G\#|E|F\#}
As of now I beg you got me wrong.
So unsure you run from something strong.



I
Can't let go.
Threadbare tapestry un-winding slow.
Feel
A tortured brain.
Show your belly like you want me to.



As of now I beg you got me wrong.
So unsure you run from something s[G\#]trooo[F\#]oooo[A]ng.
I haven't f[E]elt like th[F\#]is in so l[A]ong.
W[G\#]rooo[F\#]oooo[A]ng.



In a sense, too far gone from love.
That won't last for-ever.
Something's gotta turn out right.



You
Sugar taste.
Sweetness doesn't of-ten touch my face.
Stay
If you please.
You may not be here when I leave.



As of now I beg you got me wrong.
So unsure you run from something s[G\#]trooo[F\#]oooo[A]ng.
I haven't felt like this in so long.
W[G\#]rooo[F\#]oooo[A]ng.



In a sense, too far gone from love.
That won't last for-ever.
Something's gotta turn out right.
