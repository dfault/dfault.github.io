\begin{guitar}
(Capo 3rd fret)

[D]I'd be riding horses if they'd [C]let me
[Em]Sleep outside at night and not take [D]fright
[D]I would ride the range and never [C]worry
[Em]I would disappear into the [D]night

[C]Every[Em]body needs an [D]angel
[C]But here's that [Em]devil by my [D]side
[C]A death's head [Em]ring upon his [D]finger
[C]Poor boy [Em]hanging on the [D]light

They'll be drawing straws inside the courtroom
As the sudden twilight turns to black
And torches burn into the sad eyes
On the wrong side of the track

Make those horses jump through hoops of flame
They won't kick and they won't scream
Let the good Lord do the driving
While poor boy sinks in the stream

Well, I can smell the campfires burning
But I'll go out walking on my own
By day and night the world keeps turning
Frightened people hiding in their homes

Everybody needs his angel
But here's that devil by my side
A death's head ring upon his finger
Poor boy hanging on the light
And everybody needs an angel
But here's that devil by my side
A death's head ring upon his finger
Poor boy hanging on the light
