\begin{guitar}
[G]Sitting in the morning [B7]sun I'll be [C]sitting when the evening [A]comes
[G]watching the ships roll [B7]in and I'll [C]watch 'em roll away [A]again yea
I'm [G]sitting on the dock of the [E]bay watching the [G]tide roll [E]away ooh
I'm just [G]sitting on the dock of the [A]bay wasting [G]time [E] $\quad$

I left my home in Georgia headed for the Frisco bay
'cause I've had nothing to live for
and look like nothing's gonna come my way

So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay watching the tide roll away ooh
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time

[G]Looks [D]like [C]nothing's gonna change [G]everyth[D]ing still rem[C]ains the same
[G]I can't [D]do what [C]ten people tell me to do [F]so I guess I'll rem[D]ain the same yes

Sitting here resting my bones and this loneliness won't leave me alone
two thousand miles I roam just to make this dock my home
now I'm just go sit at the dock of the bay watching the tide roll away ooh
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time
