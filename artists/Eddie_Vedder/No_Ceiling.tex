\begin{guitar}
C[Dm]omes the m[G]orning
When I can f[C]eel
That there's n[F]othing
Left to be conce[Dm]aled

M[Dm]oving o[G]n,
a scene surre[C]al
Know my h[F]eart will never
Never be f[G]ar from here

S[Am]ure a[C]s I'm l[G]eaving
S[Dm]ure as I'm s[Am]ad
[Am]I'll k[C]eep this w[G]isdom
I[Dm]n my fle[Am]sh

I[Am]   l[C]eave here b[G]elieving
M[Dm]ore than I h[Am]ad
A[Am]nd th[C]ere's a r[G]eason I'll be
Re[G]ason I'll be b[F]ack


As I walk
the Hemisphere
Got my wish
to up and disappear

I been wounded
I been healed
Now for landing I been
Landing I been cleared

Sure as I'm leaving
Sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom
In my flesh

I leave here believing
More than I had
This Love has got
No Ceiling
