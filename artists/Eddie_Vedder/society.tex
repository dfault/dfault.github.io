\chords{Am}

[C]It's a [G]mystery to [Am]me
we have a [C]greed with [F]which we have [G]agreed
You [F]think you have to [G]want more than you [Am]need
[F]until you have it [G]all you won't [Am]be free

[F]society, you're a crazy [C]breed
I hope you're not [G]lonely without [Am]me

When you want more than you have you think you need
and when you think more than you want your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
cause when you have more than you think you need more space

society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
society, crazy and deep
I hope you're not lonely without me

there's those thinking more or less less is more
but if less is more how you're keeping score?
Means for every point you make your level drops
kinda like its starting from the top
you can't do that...

society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
society, crazy and deep
I hope you're not lonely without me

society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
society, crazy and deep
I hope you're not lonely without me
