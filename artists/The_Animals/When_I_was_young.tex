The rooms were so much colder then, my father was a soldier then,
and times were very hard, when I was young.   When I was young.

I smoked my first cigarette at ten, and for girls I had a bad yearn,
and I had quite a ball when I was young.\qquad\chords{Em D}



When I was [G]young it was [Em]more important,
[G]pain, more pain, but I [Em]laughed so much louder, [D]yeah !
When I was [Em]young.    When [D]I was [Em]young.


 
I met my first love at thirteen, she was brown and I was pretty green,
and I learned quite a lot, when I was young.   When I was young



\chords{Gm, F, Gm, F, Gm, F, Gm}



When [Bb]I was young it was [Gm]more important,
[Bb]pain, more pain, but I [Gm]laughed so much louder, [F]yeah !
When I was [Gm]young.    When [F]I was [Gm]young.



My [Gm]faith was so much [F]stronger then, [Gm]I believed in [F]fellow men,
and [Gm]I was so much [F]older then -
when [F]I was [Gm]young,     
when [F]I was [Gm]young,     
when [F]I was [Gm]young..
