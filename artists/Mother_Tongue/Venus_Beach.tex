[G]They say [A]love [G]is bl[H]ind
But I don't see [A]it
Won't get you off my mind
You're firmly in it's grip
Iceberg's find pleasure ships
Their sides ripped wide
Hearts shudder and quit
They break and die

[G]Wading in sh[D]allow water
[C]You were meant to sw[G]im
[D]One of [C]Venus' daughters
[G]Love is a wh[D]im

You're making tracks and I'm losing ground

Captain of the ship
That's going down
Waters close to sip
Hang on and drown
Life is precious
In the light of fear
Love is vicious
As a pool of tears

You're making tracks and I'm losing ground

They say love is blind
But I don't see it
Won't get you off my mind
You're firmly in it's grip

Wading in shallow water
You were meant to swim
One of Venus' daughters
Love is a whim

You're making tracks and I'm losing ground
