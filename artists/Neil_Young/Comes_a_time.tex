\begin{guitar}
C[G]omes a time, Wh[Bm]en your driftin’ [D]\\
Comes a time, When you settle d[Am7]own [C]\\

C[G]omes a light F[Bm]eelin’s liftin’ [D]\\
Lift that baby right up o[Am7]ff the ground [C]\\



O[G]h, th[F]is old wor[C]ld keeps sp[G]innin’ ‘round 
It’s a w[F]onder tall tr[C]ees ain’t l[G]aying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime



Y[G]ou and I, W[Bm]e were captured [D]\\
We took our souls, And we flew [Am7]away [C]\\

W[G]e were right W[Bm]e were giving [D]\\
That’s how we kept what w[Am7]e gave awa[C]y\\



O[G]h, th[F]is old wor[C]ld keeps sp[G]innin’ ‘round 
It’s a w[F]onder tall tr[C]ees ain’t l[G]aying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime
