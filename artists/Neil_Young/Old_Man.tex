O[D]ld man l[F]ook at my life 
T[C]wenty four and there's s[G]o much more
L[D]ive alone in a p[F]aradise
That m[C]akes me think of t[F]wo
L[D]ove lost, s[F]uch a cost,

R[F]ollin' home to y[G]ou.

O[D]ld man take a look at my life I'm a [am7]lot like [Em7]yo[G]u

O[D]h, one look in my eyes and you can t[Am7]ell that's t[em7]rue.

\chords{D|F|C|G| D|F|C|F}

Lullabies, look in your eyes,
Run around the same old town.
Doesn't mean that much to me 
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past.
But I'm all alone at last.
Rolling home to you.

Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you were \ \ \ x2
