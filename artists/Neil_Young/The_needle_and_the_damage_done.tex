\begin{guitar}
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more
Ooh, ooh, the damage done.


I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done.


I sing the song because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out.


I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun.
\end{guitar}
