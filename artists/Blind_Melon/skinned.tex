\chords{G|G|E7|E7}

[G]I'll make a shoehorn outta your shin
[G]I'll make a lampshade of durable skin
And [E7]oh, don't you know that I'm always feelin' able
[E7]When I'm sittin' home and I'm carving out your navel
[G]im just a sittin' here carving out your navel


[C]When will I [B]realize that this [C]skin I'm in
Hey, it [B]isn't mine
[C]And when will the [B]kill be too much [C]meat for me to [B]hide [E7]on


Hey, I could really use a couple of hands
To complete one hell of a plant stand
Oh, and don't you know that I'm caught here in the middle
Making rib cages into coffee tables
I'm just makin' em into coffee tables

And when will I realize that this skin I'm in
Hey, it isn't mine
And when will the thrill be too much meat for me to find anymore



Oh, because you [C]know I can't hide
But oh how [G]hard I try
But [D]this is just the shape I'm [G]in, oh yeah
al[Em]though I know I can't hide
But oh [A]how hard I try
But [C]this is just the [D]shape I'm [G]in
oh yeah, oh yeah
