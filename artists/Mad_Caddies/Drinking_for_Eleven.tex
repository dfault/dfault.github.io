[F]Drinking for eleven, that's just what I [A]do,
When I'm not with [Bb]you, [Bbm]my heart goes to [F]bed.
[F]End of the bar, that's just where I'll [A]be,
Don't try and come find [Bb]me, cause [Bbm]I'm already [F]dead

With one eye tied upon the open road,
I feel your presence and I can't let it go.
It moves so slowly as it creeps into my mind,
Steals every breath I have and leaves my heart behind

Wanna know what you're feeling if your feeling alone
I wanna hear if you still care
The last time I remember you was the last time I wasn't scared

When the nights start fading and the mornin' arrives
I wanna still feel you around
Will you creep into my head again and pick me up off the ground
Once more, tell me what you're fighting for

[F]Gotta try gotta [C]try for tom[Dm]orrow [Bb] $\quad$
[F]When you [C]can't see through tod[Dm]ay [Bb] $\quad$
[F]Gotta try, gotta [C]try for tom[Dm]orrow [Bb] $\quad$
[F]When you [C]can't see through tod[Dm]ay
There's nowhere left to [Bb]stay

Sometimes it feels like I'm out here all alone
Just one in million stuck with no place left to go
The fear steps up to me with every move that I make
Following close behind my soul it wants to take
Wanna know what you're feeling if your feeling alone
I wanna hear if you still care
The last time I remember you was the last time I wasn't scared

When the nights start fading and the mornin' arrives
I wanna still feel you around
Will you creep into my head again and pick me up off the ground
Once more, tell me what you're fighting for

Gotta try gotta try for tomorrow
When you can't see through today
Gotta try, gotta try for tomorrow
When you can't see through today
There's nowhere left to stay
Whoa!

Drinking for a living, that's just what I do,
When I'm not with you,
My heart goes to bed
