B[G]obby Said the times were a Changin[em]g
n[G]ow they're sitting in my blind spot wait[em]ing
B[C]eeping their horns, coming on f[A]ast
[C]I changed lanes or Otherwise Cr[D]ash



Tell me mister what do you know?
You tell me that things are moving to slow
Cause all I see is the Stoplight Red
nothing moving dead up a head



[em]Everything explodes theirs n[C9]o survivors
[em]I'm in the car there ain't n[C9]o Driver
M[em]y lips moving in anticip[C9]ation
Th[D]ere's always something in my blindspot waiting

There's always something in my
There's always something in my
There's always something in my blindspot waiting
There's always something in my
There's always something in my
There's always something in my blindspot waiting
There's always something in my
There's always something in my
There's always something in my blindspot waiting
