Chorus:
{}[E]Do you rem[A]ember all those l[C#]onely nights togeth[F#]er
More than our sw[B]eet days, our sw[E]eet days in the [A]su[E]n
Do you rem[A]ember all those l[C#]onely nights toegeth[F#]er
Honey, [B]I rem[E]ember every [A]one


Verse:
{}[C#]   Remember driving home from the p[F#]ark
{}[B]  You yelled at me about my porno mags
{}[E]  In front of my sister
{}[C#]   Remeber all those nights we h[F#]ad such a ball
{}[B]  Putting my fist through the wall can
{}[E]  Make such a bl[E7]ister... [E6]Ahhh[E]h...



Do you remember all those lonely nights together
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
Honey, I remember every one



Remember when you threw my clothes out the window
You know it's pretty clear that way
To see which way the wind blows
Remember how I left the light on
You didn't like that very much
You really put the bite on



Do you remember all those lonely nights together
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
Honey, I remember every one



And you remember that time that,
Well, I don't have to go into that. That time...
The other time, when I was comin' home and you were...
Well I know you couldn't forget, the time I said...
I know, we can laugh about that now...
