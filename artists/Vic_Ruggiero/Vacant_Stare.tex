\begin{guitar}

[E]I Waited long when there was [c#]no one there for me
[E]I held your hand down there when [c#]no one else could see,
[A]kissed you [B]lips and with them i [E]swore i'd always be there 
[A]for your [a]vacant stare

When i said these words, i thought you may have wept,
that dreamin was the only reason that i slept
and boredom was the only company i kept, except
for your vacant stare

[B]thanks but i'm aware of all the [E]things im not
[B]thanks for the television [E]memories i got
[B]suffice to say our chemistr[E]y was simply hot [F#]air
and your vacant [B]stare

so excepting evil is just as it does
I promised i'd be all i could be just because
but thought i looked this hard i found the cubbert was bare

but for your vacant stare
but for your vacant stare
but for your vacant stare
