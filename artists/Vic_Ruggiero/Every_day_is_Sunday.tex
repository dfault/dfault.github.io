[G]Every day is Sunday when you're [e]unemployed
[G]Hey, it sounds pretty good, man, I should be [e]overjoyed
But wh[a]en every day is S[D]unday
Wh[a]en every day is S[D]unday
Wh[a]en every day is S[C]unday
Fr[D]iday never c[G]ome[D]s


Do you think I should write a novel, maybe write some songs
I'll show you how I'm the genius you thought I was all along
But every day is Sunday
Every day is Sunday
Every day is Sunday
Friday never comes




I got..[f#].
\qquad Nothin' to d[Bm]o
Than to sit here.[f#]..
\qquad Starin at y[Bm]ou
And you got..[f#].
\qquad Nothin' to s[Bm]ay
That I wanna [G]hea[A]r


You got...
\qquad Nothin' to say
So I'm just...
\qquad Wastin' away
I guess I'll...
\qquad  go outside 
and do nothing


[G]Every day is Sunday when you're [e]unemployed
[G]Every tomorrow's M[e]onday  
\end{guitar}
