Intro:\qquad \chords{E|Ab|Dbm|B}


I don't pr[E]actice santeria I ain't [Ab]got no crystal ball
I [Dbm]had a million dollars but [B]I'd, I'd spend it all
If I could [E]find that Heina and that [Ab]Sancho she's found
Well I'd [Dbm]pop a cap in Sancho and I'd [B]slap her down



[A]All I [B]really wanna [E]know my [Dbm]baby
[A]All I [B]really wanna [E]say I [Dbm]can't de[A]fine
It's [B]love that I [E]nee[Dbm]d 
[A]But my soul [B]will have to
 


Wait 'till I get back, find a Heina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break
And I gotta live it up Oh yeah, uh huh, well I swear that I



All I really wanna know my baby
All I really wanna say I can't define
That love will make it go
My soul will have to...


Solo



All I really wanna say my baby
All I really wanna say is I've got mine
And I'll make it yes I'm comin' up
Tell Sanchito that if
He knows what is good for him he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new 45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I've got something for his punk ass



Well I really wanna know my baby
What I really wanna say is there's just one way back
And I'll make it
yeah my soul will have to wait
