[E]As I was walkin down rubadub squ[B]are 
[E]Not a chill to the window a little to the [B]air 
[A]From another [E]direction [A]she was caught in my e[E]ye
[A]It could be an [E]illusion, but [A]I might as well [E]try
..might as well [B]try



[E]She had rings on her fingers and bells on her sh[B]oes 
[E]And I could tell without asking she was into the bl[B]ues 
[A]She wore sc[E]arlet begonias t[A]ucked into her c[E]urls
[A]I knew right [E]away she was [A]not like other g[E]irls
..other gir[B]ls



Well [F#]I ain't never been right as I ain't never been wrong
As [B]everthing works out the [E]way it [A]does in this [E]song
[F#]Cause once in a while you get shown in the light
In the st[B]rangest of places [E]if you [A]look at it [E]right

It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above
Because the women took the lovin over me
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus
Because I sold off my personal property
A tie-dyed dress , she was a psychadelic mess
We toured to the north, south, east and west
We sold some mushroom tea,
Sold some ectacy,
Sold nitrus, opium, acid, herion and PCP
Now I hear the police coming after me
Now I hear the police coming after me
The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair,
She's got the police coming after me



Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
All scarlet begoinas and a touch of the blues
And there ain't nothin wrong with the love that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way just to let her  pass by.
