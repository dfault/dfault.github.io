``She was living in a single room with three other individuals 
 One of them was a male and the other two...well 
 the other two were females! 
 God only knows what they were up to in there. 
 And furthermore Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that 
 all four of them habitually smoked marijuana cigarettes!
 REEFERS!\" 

\chords{Am|F|G|G\#}
 
I sm[Am]oke two joints in the morning 
I sm[F]oke two joints at night 
I sm[Am]oke two joints in the afternoon 
It m[F]akes me feel all right 
 
I smoke two joints in time of peace 
And two in time of war 
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints, 
And then I smoke two more 
 

\chords{Am|F|G|G\#}
 
``Smoked cigarettes till the day she died
Toke a big spliff of some good sensimillia\"
 
Daddy he once told me, 
'Son, you be hard workin' man' 
And momma she once told me, 
'Son, you do the best you can' 
But th[G]en one day I met a man, 
He c[F]ame to me and said, 
'Hard w[G]ork good and hard w[F]ork fine, 
but f[E]irst take care of head'
 
Whoa rock me to the night 
Ja say Whoa
