Early in the morning
Rise to the street
Light me up that cigarette 
and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason 
Reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason 
why the money's all gone

I got a dalmation 
And I can still get high
I can play the guitar 
Like a motherfuckin' riot

Well life is (too short) 
So love the one you got
Cause you might get run over
or you might get shot

Never start no static
I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no 
bulletproof vest 

Take a small example 
Take a tip from me
Take all of your money
Give it up to charity

Lovin' is what I got 
Is within my reach
And the sublime style
is still straight from Long Beach

It all comes back to you 
You'll find what you deserve
Try ann test that 
Your bound to get served

Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when
the dance get's hot

Lovin' is
What i got
I said remember that
Lovin' is 
What I got
Now remember that
\columnbreak

I don't cry 
When my dog runs away
I don't get angry 
at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry
when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle 
and goes right to the rock

Fuck it fight it
It's all the same
Livin with Louie's Dog
The only way to stay sane

Let the lovin' 
Let the lovin come back to me
