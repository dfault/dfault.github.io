[(Dm)]We passed upon the st[A7]airs, We spoke of was and [Dm]when
Although I wasn't t[A7]here, he said i was his f[F]riend
Which came as some surpr[C]ise, I spoke into his [A]eyes
I thought you died al[Dm]one, a long long time ag[C]o



Oh n[C]o,\qquad not m[F]e
I n[Bbm]ever lost contr[F]ol
Your'e f[C]ace      to f[F]ace
with the m[Bbm]an who sold the w[A]orld



I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years i roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone' a long long time ago



Who knows?\qquad not me
We never lost control
Your'e face to face
with the man who sold the world
