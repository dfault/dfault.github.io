Excuse me Mr.
do you have the time
or are you so important
that it stands still for you

excuse me Mr.
lend me your ear
or are you not only blind
but do you not hear

excuse me Mr.
isn't that your oil in the sea
and the pollution in the air Mr.
whose could that be

excuse me Mr.
but I'm a mister too
and you're givin'Mr a bad name
Mr. like you

so I'm taking the Mr.
from out in front of your name
cause it's a Mr. like you
that puts the rest of us to shame
it's a Mr. like you
that puts the rest of us to shame

and I've seen enough to know
that I've seen too much

excuse me Mr.
can't you see thechildren dying
you say that you can't help them
Mr. you're not even trying

excuse me Mr.
take a look around
Mr just look up
and you'll see it's comin'down

excuse me Mr.
but I'm a mister too
and you're givin'Mr a bad name
Mr. like you

so I'm taking the Mr.
from out in front of your name
cause it's a Mr. like you
that puts the rest of us to shame
it's a Mr. like you
that puts the rest of us to shame

and I've seen enough to know
that I've seen too much

\columnbreak
so Mr. when you're rattling
on heaven's gate
let me tell you Mr.
by then it's too late

cause Mr. when you get there
they don't ask how much you saved
all they'l want to know,Mr.
is what you gave

excuse me Mr.
but I'm a mister too
and you're givin'Mr a bad name
Mr. like you

so I'm taking the Mr.
from out in front of your name
cause it's a Mr. like you
that puts the rest of us to shame
it's a Mr. like you
that puts the rest of us to shame
