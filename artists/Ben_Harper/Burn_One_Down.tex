\begin{guitar}
Let u[G]s burn one from end to end
and p[Em]ass it over to m[C]e my friend
bu[G]rn it long, we'll burn it slow
to l[Em]ight me up be[C]fore I go 



if y[G]ou don't like my fire
then d[Em]on't come around
cause I'm gonna b[D]urn one d[C]ow[G]n
ye[Em]s I'm gonna b[D]urn one dow[C]n



my choice is what I choose to do
and if I'm causing no harm it shouldn't bother you
your choice is who you choose to be
and if your causin' no harm then you're alright with me 



if you don't like my fire
then don't come around
cause I'm gonna burn one down
yes I'm gonna burn one down



herb the gift from the earth
and what's from the earth is of the greatest worth
so before you knock it try it first
you'll see it's a blessing and not a curse 



if y[G]ou don't like my fire
then d[Em]on't come around
caus[D]e I'm gonna b[C]urn one dow[G]n
ye[Em]s I'm gonna b[D]urn one dow[C]n
