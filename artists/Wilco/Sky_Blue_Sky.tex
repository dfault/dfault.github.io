\begin{guitar}
O[C]h, the band marched on in format[Am]ion
Th[Dm]e brass w[F]as phas[G]ing tunes I couldn’t place
W[Fmaj7]indows open and r[Em]aining i[Am]n
M[Dm]aroon, yellow, bl[F]ue, gold and g[C]ray



Th[C]e drunks were ric[Am]ocheting
Th[Dm]e old buildin[F]gs downtown
E[G]mpty so long ago
W[Fmaj7]indows broken and d[Em]reami[Am]ng
S[Dm]o happy to l[F]eave what was my h[C]ome



W[G]ith a sky blue sky
Th[G7]is rotten time
W[Am]ouldn’t seem so b[Dm]ad to me now
O[G]h, I didn’t die
[G7]I should be satisfied
[Am]I survived
That's good enough for n[Dm]ow



With a sky blue sky
This rotten time
Wouldn’t seem so bad to me now
Oh, if I didn’t die
I should be satisfied
I survived
That's good enough for
