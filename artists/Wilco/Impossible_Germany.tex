I[Am7sus4]mpossible Germany 
U[Cmaj7]nlikely Japan
W[G]herever you g[Em7]o
Wherever you l[Am7sus4]and\qquad\qquad\qquad[Am7]{}

I’ll say what this means to me
I’ll do what I can
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan



T[Cmaj7]he fundamental probl[Am7]em
W[Cmaj7]e all need to fac[Am7]e
T[G]his is imp[Em7]ortant
B[Am7]ut I know you’re not list[Cmaj7]ening
O[Am7]h I know you’re not listen[Cmaj7]ing



This was still new to me
I wouldn’t understand
Impossible Germany 

Unlikely Japan
This is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face



With no larger problems
That need to be erased
Nothing more important 
Than to know someone’s listening
Now I know you’ll be listening
