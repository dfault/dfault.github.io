You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do,
I don't understand the evil eye,
Or how one becomes two.
And I just can't recall what started it all,
Or how to begin in the end,
I ain't here to break it,
Just see how far it will bend,
Again and again,

I wanna make it,
I wanna make it wit chu,
Anytime, anywhere,
I wanna make it,
I wanna make it wit chu,

Sometimes the same is different,
but mostly it's the same
these mysteries of life, that just ain't my thing
if I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon,
I'd be untrue,
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wanna do,
anytime, anywhere and I say

I wanna make it, (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu,
Anytime, anywhere,
I wanna make it, (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu,
I wanna make it, (anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu,
I wanna make it,
I wanna make it wit chu.

I wanna make it, (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu,
I wanna make it, (anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu,
I wanna make it, (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu,
I wanna make it, (again and again and again and again and again..)
