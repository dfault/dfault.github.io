\begin{guitar}
S[Bm]aw you lying on the marble slab
The best trip that I've ever had
High up in a jet plane, pass it around
My drinks on empty, need another round



[Bm]I wanna fl[G]y, wanna ride with y[E]ou
I[Bm]s this the b[G]est that you can d[E]o?
[Bm]I wanna fl[G]y, wanna ride with y[E]ou
H[Bm]igh up i[G]n a jet plane with y[E]ou



W[Bm]ill we arrive in the middle of nowhere
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times
I never seen you before
But now that I have, I don't wanna see you no more



H[Bm]igh up in a j[G]et plane with y[E]ou
H[Bm]igh up in a j[G]et plane with y[E]ou



I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
High up in a jet plane with you



A[C]h-a[G]h, a[A]uto pilot n[E]o control
A[C]h-a[G]h, a[A]hh
A[C]h-a[G]h, a[A]uto pilot n[E]o control
A[C]h-a[G]h, a[E]hh



High up in a jet plane with you
High up in a jet plane with you



I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
High up in a jet plane with you
