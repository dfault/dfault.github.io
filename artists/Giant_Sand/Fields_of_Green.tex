t[F]hey’ve been killing off all my heroes s[C]ince i was 1[F]7
and some have disappear so mysteriously never to be s[C]een
o[F]thers have been lovingly laid o[C]ut in a field of gr[F]een

like the o[Dm]ld woman of the desert
or the young s[Am]urfer by the sea
the t[Gm]eachers of such pathways
that would o[C]nly ever teach for free

like the b[Dm]leeding trailblazers
and the sl[Am]eepy stipulators
the w[Gm]icked wander-lusters
or the cl[C]owning crop-dusters

t[F]hey’ve been killing off all my heroes s[C]ince i was 1[F]7

when finally hitting 40
the losses seem to quicken
as if an extra season was added
each year just for the stricken

losses by the numbers
disasters by the score
when the art of acceptance
can't even expect you to accept any more

that which doesn't kill you really does make you stronger

now i amble over 50
and the longest hours move so swiftly
such young fresh folk
look to me as such path finder
and it's in my crinkel smile
in my smoldering spark eyed glisten
I strug them to be so quiet for just a while
and give your own heart a good listen

t[F]hey’ve been killing off all your heroes s[C]ince you were 1[F]7
some will go on to disappear so mysteriously never to be seen
o[F]thers will get lovingly laid o[C]ut in a field of gr[F]een
