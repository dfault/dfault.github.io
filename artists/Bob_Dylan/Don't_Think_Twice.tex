\begin{guitar}
It a[C]in't no use to s[G]it and wonder w[Am]hy, babe 
I[F]f you don't know by [C]now[G]{} 
An' it a[C]in't no use to s[G]it and wonder w[Am]hy, babe 
[D7]It'll never do someh[G]ow 
When your r[C]ooster crows at the b[C7]reak of dawn 
L[F]ook out your window and I'l[D7]l be gone 
Y[C]ou're the r[G]eason I'm t[Am]rav'lin' o[F]n 
D[C]on't think t[G]wice, it's all r[C]ight 



It ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
Don't think twice,it's all right



It ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
Like you never did before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' all the way down the road
I once loved aw woman,a child I'm told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice,it's all right



So loooooong, honey babe
Where I'm bound,I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word,babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice,it's all right
