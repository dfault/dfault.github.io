\chords{C|Csus4}
[G]You must leave now, take what you need, you [F]think will [C]last
But what[G]ever you wish to keep, you better [F]grab it [C]fast
[Dm]Yonder stands your [F]orphan with his [C]gun
[Dm]Crying like a [F]fire in the [C]sun
[E]Look out the saints [F]are com[G]ing through
And [Dm]it's all over [F]now, Baby [C]Blue.



The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.



All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.



Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
