D[B]o you feel like a chain store?
Pr[A]actically fl[E]oored
[G]One of many z[F]eros
K[Bb]icked around b[C#]ored
Y[B]our ears are full, but you're empty
H[A]olding out your h[E]eart
T[G]o people who never r[F]eally
C[A#]are how you [A]are



S[C#m]o give me Coffee and TV
H[B]istor[A]y 
[C#m]I've seen so much
I'm g[E]oing blind
And I'm br[A]aindead virtuall[B]y
'Cos S[C#m]ociability
It's h[B]ard enough for m[A]e
T[C#m]ake me away from this b[E]ig bad world
[A]And agree to marry m[D]e
So we can start [A]over again



D[B]o you go to the country?
It [A]isn't very f[E]ar
Th[G]ose people there will h[F]urt you
'C[Bb]os of who you [C#]are
Y[B]our ears are full of the language
There's w[A]isdom there you're s[E]ure
'T[G]il the words start sl[F]urring
[A#]And you can't find the d[A]oor
