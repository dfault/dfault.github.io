\begin{guitar}
Now she's w[Em]alking through th[G]e clouds
With a c[Am]ircus mind that's running w[Em]ild
B[Bm]utterflies and zebras a[Am]nd moonbeams, and fairy t[C]al[G]es
A[F]ll she ever thinks about is 
R[C]id[D]ing with the wind


When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, it's alright she says
Take anything you want from me\ldots
Anything

\end{guitar}
