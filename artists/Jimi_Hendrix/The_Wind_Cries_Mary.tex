\begin{guitar}
A[C]fter all the j[Bb]acks are in their b[F]oxes
A[C]nd the clowns have a[Bb]ll gone to b[F]ed
Y[C]ou can hear happiness st[Bb]aggering on d[F]own the street
F[G]ootsteps d[Bb]ressed in r[Eb]ed
A[G]nd the w[Bb]ind whispers M[Eb]ary



A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken peices of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary



The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptyness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary



Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary
\end{guitar}
