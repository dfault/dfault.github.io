\chords{A|Dsus2}
[A]Woke up cold one tuesday,
[C9]i'm looking tired and [G]feeling quite sick, 
[A]i felt like there was something missing in my [C9]day to day [E]life, 
so i [A]quickly opened the wardrobe, 
[C9]pulled out some jeans and a [G]T-Shirt that seemed clean, 
[A]topped it off with a pair of old shoes, 
that were [C9]ripped around the [E]seams,
and i thought [Dsus2]these shoes just don't suit me. 



[A]Hey, I put some [E]new shoes on, 
and [Dsus2]suddenly everything is right,
I said, [A]hey, I put some [E]new shoes on 
and [Dsus2]everybody's smiling, its so inviting, 
Oh, [A]short on money, but [E]long on time,
[Dsus2]slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
and [A]i'm running late,
and i dont [E]need an excuse,
'cause i'm [Dsus2]wearing my brand new shoes.
 
 
 
Woke up late one thursday,
i'm seeing stars as i'm rubbing my eyes, 
and i felt like there were two days missing, 
as i focused on the time,
and i made my way to the kitchen,
but i had to stop from the shock of what i found,
a room full of all my friends dancing round and round,
and i thought hello new shoes, byebye blues. 

 
 
Chorus  

 
 
[A]Take me wondering through these stree[C9]ts, 
[A]where bright lights and angels m[C9]eet, 
[A]stone to stone they take me [C9]on,  
im [Dsus2]walking to the break of dawn. (x2) 

 
 
Chorus (x2)
 
 
 
[Dsus2]Take me wondering through these streets
