[C]This is the [E]first day of my [Am]life
[F]Swear I was [G]born right in the [C]doorway
[C]I went out in the [E]rain, suddenly everything ch[Am]anged
They're spreading [D7]blankets on the [G]beac[G9]h

[C]Yours is the [E]first face that I [Am]saw
[F]Think I was [G]blind before I [C]met you
[C]Don't know where I [E]am, don't know where I've [Am]been
But I [D7]know where I want to [G]go
 

So I [C]thought I'd [G]let you [Am]know
That [F]these things take for[G]ever
I esp[C]eciall[C/B]y am [Am]slow
But [Dminsus2]I realized how I need you and I wondered if I could come h[C]ome 


\chords{G|Am|Dminsus2|Fminsus2|Fminsus2}


I remember the time you drove all night 
Just to meet me in the morning 
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed 
You felt as if you'd just woke up 

And you said, "This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
Now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
And I'd probably be happy.


So if [C]you want [G]to be with [Am]me 
With [F]these things there's [G]no telling 
We'll just [C]have to [C/B]wait and [Am]see
But I'd [Dminsus2]rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lotter[C]y 

\chords{E|Am}

Besides, [Dminsus2]maybe this time its different, I mean I really think you [C]like me
