\begin{guitar}
I [C]wish I [Cmaj7]had a [C7]parachute cuz I'm [F]falling bad for [G7]you [G] $\quad$
And I can [C]see the [Cmaj7]ground appr[C7]oaching now
But I'm [F]not sure what to [G7]do [G] $\quad$
I [Am]feel like a [D/F#]pinata once you [F]take a swing at [G7]me [G] $\quad$
If [Am]you could just crack the [D/F#]shell open
I think [F]inside you would [G]find something [C]sweet. [F] $\quad$ [C]

And I hear you like a hunter now, your footsteps in the leaves
And I would gladly leave my hiding place
So I'm hoping to be seen.
So let your arrow fly
And see I'm well within your aim
And lay your traps for a thousand miles
And please don't let me escape.

Winter came to Omaha and left us looking like a bride
A million perfect snowflakes now
And no two are alike
And so it's hard for me imagining flaws in this design
I know debris, it covers everything
But still I am in love with this life.
