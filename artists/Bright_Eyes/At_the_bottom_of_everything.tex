\begin{guitar}
\chords{C F x 3}

[C]we must talk in every telephone get [F]eaten off the [C]web
[C]we must rip out all the epilogues in the [F]books that we have [G]read 
[C]and to the face of every criminal [F]strapped firmly to a chair
[C]we must stare, we must stare, [G]we must [C]stare

we must take all of the medicines to expensive now to [C]sell
set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell
and to the ear of every anarchist who sleeps but doesn't dream
we must sing, we must sing, we must sing



it'll go like this alright



[F]While my mother [G]waters plants my father [C]loads his [F]gun
[F]he say death will [G]bring us back to [Am]god, just like the setting [F]sun
[G]is returned to the lonesome ocean



\chords{C F x 3}



we must blend into the choir sing a static with the whole
we must memorize 9 numbers and deny we have a soul
and in this endless race for property and privilege to be won
we must run, we must run, we must run

we must hang up in the belphry where the bats and moonlight laugh
we must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
and into the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlight and our love
we must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge



oh my mornings coming back the whole worlds waking up
all the city buses swimming past i'm happy just because 
i found out i'm really no one


\chords{c f x 3 c}
