(Capo 7th fret)


I [G]know that it is freezing but I think we have to [C]walk
I keep [G]waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights [G]off
But [Am]Julie knows a party at some actor's westside [D]loft
Supplies are [C]endless in the [Am]evening, by the [C]morning [D]they'll be [G]gone

When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit

And I [C]know you have a heavy heart
I can [G]feel it when we kiss
So [C]many men stronger than me
have thrown their [G]backs out trying to [A7]lift it
But [C]me I'm not a [Em]gamble, you can [G]count on [D]me to [C]split
The love I [C]sell you in the [Am]evening, by the [C]morning [D]won't [G]exist

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid I think you got it bad
What's so easy in the evening, by the morning's such a drag

I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same
Well, we might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane

And I'm [C]not sure what the trouble was
that [G]started all of this
The [C]reasons all have run away
But the [G]feeling never [A7]did
It's not [C]something I would [Em]recommend
But it [G]is one [D]way to [C]live
Cause what is [C]simple in the [Am]moonlight, by the [C]morning [D]never [G]is
It was so [C]simple in the [Am]moonlight, now it's [C]so compl[D]icat[Em]ed
It was so [Am]simple in the [C]moonlight
So [Am]simple in the [C]moonlight
So [Am]simple in the [C]moonlight
