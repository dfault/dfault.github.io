\begin{guitar}

Well we are [A]big rock singers, we've got golden fingers
And we're loved everywhere we [E]go
We sing about beauty and we sing about truth
At ten thousand dollars a [A]show
We take all kind of pills to give us all kind of thrills
But the thrill we've never [E]known
Is the thrill that'll get you when you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling [A]Stone



[A]Rolling [E]Stone\ldots  \qquad  {\sl Wanna see my picture on the cover}
[E]Rolling [A]Stone\ldots  \qquad  {\sl Wanna buy five copies for my mother}
[A]Rolling [E]Stone\ldots  \qquad  {\sl Wanna see my smilin' face}
On the [D]cover of the Rolling Stone


I've got a freaky old lady name o' Cocaine Katy
Who embroiders on my jeans
I've got my poor old gray-haired Daddy
Drivin' my limousine
Now it's all designed to blow our minds
But our minds won't really be blown
Like the blow that'll get you when you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

-- Refrain --

We got a lot of little teenage blue-eyed groupies
Who do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian guru
He's teachin' us a better way
We got all the friends that money can buy
So we never have to be alone
And we keep gettin' richer but we can't get our picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

-- Refrain --
