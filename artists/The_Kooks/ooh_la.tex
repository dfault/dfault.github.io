\begin{guitar}
In their [Am]eyes is the place that you finally discovered
That you [F]love it here, you've got to stay
On the [Dm]bottom of the rock, an island
On which you find you [Am]love it when you twitch
You feel that itch in you [F]pettycoat
Your pretty pr[Dm]etty pettycoat



Then you sm[Am]iled, he got wild
You didn't understand that there's m[F]oney to be made
Beauty is a card that m[Dm]ust get played
By organis[G]ation



And [Am]ooh [F]la, she was such a [G]good girl [Dm]to me
And [F]ooh [Am]la, the world just [G]chewed her up, and [Dm]spat her out
And [F]ooh [Am]la, she was such a [G]good girl [Dm]to me
And [F]ooh [Am]la, the world just [G]chewed her up, and [Dm]spat her out



The world can be a very big place
So be yourself don't get out of place
Love your man and love him twice
Go to Hollywood and pay the price
Oh go to Hollywood



And don't be a star, it's such a drag
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag
It's a hard life to live, so live it well
I'll be your friend and not in pretend
I know you girl
In all situations



CHORUS



Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty
Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pettycoat
Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty
Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pettycoat
In all situations



CHORUS
