\begin{guitar}
C[Am]oming in from L[Am/G]ondon from o[D/F#]ver the pole
Fl[F]yin' in a b[C]ig airl[E-E7]iner
Chickens flyin' everywhere around the plane
Could we ever feel much finer?



C[Am]omin' into L[Am/G]os Angel[D]es
Br[Am]ingin' in a co[Am/G]uple of k[D]eys
D[Am]on't touch my b[Am/G]ags if you pl[D/F#]ease mister c[F]ustoms m[C]an\ldots{}[E-E7]yeah



There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico
No, he couldn't look much stranger
Walkin' in the hall with his things and all
Smilin, said he was the lone ranger



Comin' into Los Angeles
Bringin' in a couple of keys
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man



Hip woman walkin' on the movin' floor
Trippin' on the escalator
There's a man in the line and she's blowin' his mind
Thinkin' that he's already made her



Comin' into Los Angeles
Bringin' in a couple of keys
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man
\end{guitar}
