\begin{guitar}
[C]Now believe me when [Em]I tell you that my [Am]song is really true
[Dm]I want [Em]everyone to [Fm]listen and [G]believe
[C]It's about some [Em]little people from a [Am]long time ago
[Bb]And all the [Eb]things the [Ab]neighbors didn't [G]know
[C]Early in the [Em]morning Daddy [Am]Dinky went to work
[Dm]Selling lamps and [Em]chairs to [Fm]San Ber'dino [G]Squares
[C]And I still [Em]remember mama with her [Am]apron and her pad
[Bb]Feeding all the [Am]boys in Ed's [D]Cafe



[G]Whizzing and [F]pasting and [G]pooting through the [Am]day
[G]Ronnie helping [Am]Kenny helping [Bm]burn his poots [D]away
[G]And all the [F]while on a [Eb]shelf in a [D]shed
[C]Kenny's little creature's [Ab]on [G]display



[C]Ronnie saves his [Em]numies on a [Am]window in his room
[Dm]A marvel to be [Em]seen; [Fm]dysentery [G]green
[C]While Kenny and his [Em]buddies had a [Am]game out in the back
[F]LET'S MAKE THE [G]WATER TURN [Am]BLACK!



[Em]We see them after school in a [A]world of their own
[Em]To some it might seem creepy what [A]they do...
[Em]The neighbors on the right sat and [C]watched them [B]every night
[Em]I bet you'd do the same if they was [D]you



[C]Ronnie's in the [Em]Army now and [Am]Kenny's taking pills
[Dm]Oh! How they [Em]yearn to see a [Fm]bomber [G]burn!
[C]Color flashing, [Em]thunder crashing, [Am]dynamite machine!
[F]Wait till the [G]fire turns [Am]green...
[F]Wait till the [G]fire turns [Am]green...
[F]WAIT TILL THE [G]FIRE TURNS [A]GREEN!
