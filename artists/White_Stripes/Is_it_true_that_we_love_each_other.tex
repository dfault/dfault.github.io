\begin{guitar}
W[A]ell, it's true that we love one another,
I [A]love Jack White like a little brother.
W[E]ell, Holly, I love you too, [D]but there's just so much,
T[D]hat I dont know about y[A]ou.

Jack gimme some money, to pay my bills,
All the dough i give you Holly you been usin' on pain pills.
Jack, will you call me if you're able?
Got your phone number written on the back of my bottle.

Jack I think you're pulling my leg,
And I think maybe I better ask Meg.
Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?
You know I don't care 'cause Jack really bugs me.

Why don't you ask him now?
Well, I would, but Meg I really just don't know how.
Just say, ''Jack, do you adore me?''
Well, I would, Holly, but love really bores me.

Holly gimme some of your English lovin',
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven.
Why don't you go off and love yourself?
If I did that, Holly, there won't be anything left for anybody else.

Jack it's too bad about the way that you look.
Y'know I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot.
Will the two of you cut it out,
And tell 'em what it's really all about?
