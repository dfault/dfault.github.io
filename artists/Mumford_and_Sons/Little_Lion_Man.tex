[Am]Weep for yourself, my man,
you'll never be what is in your [C]heart.
[Am]Weep little lion man,
you're not as brave as you were at the [C]start.
[G]Rate yourself and rape yourself,
[F]take all the [Fmaj7]courage you have [C]left.
[G]Wasted on fixing all the
[F]problems that you [Fmaj7]made in your own [C]head.



But it was [Am]not your f[F]ault but m[C]ine,
and it was [am]your hear[F]t on the l[C]ine.
I really f[Am]ucked it [F]up this t[C]ime,
didn't I, my d[G]ear?
Didn't I, my de[Am]ar?



\chords{Am|C|x2}

[Am]Tremble for yourself my man,
you know that you have seen this all be[C]fore.
[Am]Tremble little lion man,
you'll never settle any of your [C]scores.
[G]Your grace is wasted in your face,
your [F]boldness stands [Fmaj7]alone among the w[C]reck.
[G]Learn from your mother or else
[F]spend your days b[Fmaj7]iting your own n[C]eck.


But it was [Am]not your f[F]ault but m[C]ine,
and it was [am]your hear[F]t on the l[C]ine.
I really f[Am]ucked it [F]up this t[C]ime,
didn't I, my d[G]ear?
Didn't I, my de[Am]ar?

didn't I, my d[G]ear?
