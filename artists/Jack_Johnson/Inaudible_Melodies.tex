\begin{guitar}
Brushfire fi[F#]airytales
Itsy b[B]itsy diamond rings
Bi[F#]g fat hurricanes
Yellow b[B]elly given names
Well shortcuts c[C#]an slow you down
And in the end we're b[B]ound
To rebound off of w[F#]e \qquad[C#]{}
Well dust off y[F#]our thinking caps 
solar powered plast[B]ic plants
Pretty pictures of th[F#]ings we ate
we are only wh[B]at we hate
But in the long run [C#]we have found
silent films are f[B]ull of sound
Inaudibly f[F##]ree {}[C#7]



Sl[F#]ow down everyone 
yo[Bb]u're moving too fast
Fr[B]ames can't catch you when you're
m[G#7]oving like that



Inaudible melodies
Severe narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones help to
notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Frame lines tell me what too see
Chopping like an axe and maybe
Eisenstein should just relax



Slow down everyone 
you're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when you're
moving like that



Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
demanding refunds for the things they've seen
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen and



Slow down everyone 
you're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when you're
moving like that
