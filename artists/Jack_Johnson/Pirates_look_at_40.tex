\begin{guitar}
[G]mother mother ocean
[G]i have heard you call
[C]wanted to sail upon your waters
since i was 3ft [G]tall
Because you've seen it [am]all
[D]you've seen it [G]all



[G]i watched the men who rode you
[G]they switched from sails to steam
[C]and in your belly you hold the treasures
few have ever [G]seen
most of them are [am]dreams
[D]most of them are [G]dreams



[G]well yes i am a pirate
[G]a few hundered years to late
[C]the cannons dont thunder
[C]there's nothing to plunder
im an under 40 victim of [G]fate
arriving to [am]late
[D]arriving to [G]late



[G]i've done a bit of smuggling
[G]well i've run my share of grass
[C]i've made enough money to buy my emy
[C]but i pissed it away so [G]fast
its never ment to [am]last
[D]its never ment to [G]last



[G]well i've been drunk now 4 over 2 weeks
[G]i've passed out and i've rallied and i've sprung a few leaks
[C]but i've gotta stop wishin'
[C]i've gotta go fishin'
down to rock bottom [G]again
with just a few [am]friends
[D]just a few [G]friends
with just a few [am]friends
[D]just a few [G]friends
