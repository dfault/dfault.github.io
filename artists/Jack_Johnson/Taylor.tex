intro
 


they say [C]taylor was a good girl, [C/B]never one to be late
compl[Am]ain, express [F]ideas in her [C]brain
[C]working on the night shift, [C/B]passing out the tickets,
youre [A]gonna have to pay her [F]if you want to park [C]here[C/B]\qquad[Am]\qquad[F]\,
well [C]mommys little dancer has [C/B]quite a little secret
[Am]working on the streets now, [F]never gonna keep [C]it\qquad[C/B]\qquad[Am]\qquad[F]\,
its [C]quite an imposition and [C/B]now shes only wishing
that [Am]she would have listened [F]to the words they [C]said\qquad[C/B]\qquad[Am]\,
[F]poor taylor 


[C]She just [C/B]wanders around, [Am]unaffect[F]ed by
[C]the [C/B]winter winds [Am]and sh[F]e'll pretend that
s[C]hes somewh[C/B]ere else, [Am]so fa[F]r and clear
a[C]bout [C/B]two thousand [Am]miles from here


peter patrick pitter patters on the window
but sunny silhouette wont let him in
poor old petes got nothing because hes been falling
somehow sunny knows just where hes been
he thinks that singing on sunday is gonna save his soul
now that saturday is gone
sometimes he thinks that hes on his way
but i can see 
that his break lights are on


He just wanders around, unaffected by
the winter winds and he'll pretend that
he's somewhere else, so far and clear
about two thousand miles from here


such a tough enchilada filled up with nada
giving what she gotta give to get a dollar bill
used to be a limber chicken, times a been a ticking
nows shes finger licking to the man
with the money in his pocket flying in his rocket
only stopping by on his way to a better world
[C]\qquad[D]\qquad[F]if t[G]aylor finds a better world
[C]\qquad[D]\qquad[F]then t[G]aylor's gonna run away



outro
