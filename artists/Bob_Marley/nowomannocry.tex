\chords{C|G|Am|F}
\chords{C|G|C|G}

No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry.


[C]I re[G]member [Am]when we used to [F]sit
In the government yard in trenchtown,
Oba - obaserving the ypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we met
Good friends we had, good friends weve lost
Along the way
In this great future, you cant forget your past
So dry your tears, I say


[C]No, [G]woman, no [Am]cry [F] $\quad$
[C]No, [G]woman, no [C]cry [G] $\quad$
[C]Ah [G]little darlin, [Am]dont shed no [F]tears
[C]No, [G]woman, no [C]cry [G] $\quad$


I remember when-a we used to sit
In the government yard in trenchtown
And then georgie would make the fire lights
As it was logwood burnin through the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which Ill share with you
My feet is my only carriag
So Ive got to push on through.
But while Im gone, I mean:


Everythings gonna be all right!


So, woman, no cry;
No - no, woman - woman, no cry
Woman, little sister, dont shed no tears
No, woman, no cry
