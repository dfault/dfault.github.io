Old [G]pirates, yes, they [Em]rob i;
Sold [C]I to the merchant [Am]ships,
[G]Minutes after they [Em]took i
[C]From the [G]bottom[D]less pit.
But my [G]hand was [Em]made strong
[C]By the hand of the al[Am]mighty.
We [G]forward in this gene[Em]ration
[C]Triu[G]mphantl[D]y.
Wont you help to [G]sing
[C]These [D]songs of [G]freedom? -
cause [C]all I [D]ever [Em]have:
[C]Rede[D]mption [G]songs;
[C]Rede[D]mption [G]songs.


Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
cause none of them can stop the time.
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand aside and look? ooh!
Some say its just a part of it:
Weve got to fulfil de book.

Wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom? -
cause all I ever have:
Redemption songs;
Redemption songs;
Redemption songs.
