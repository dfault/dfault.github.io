\chords{Bm|E7|G|Fism}
Ooh, yeah! all right!
Were jammin: I wanna jam it with you.
Were jammin, jammin, And I hope you like jammin, too.


Aint no [Bm]rules, aint no [E]vow, we can [Bm]do it any[E]how:
[G]I an i will see you [F#m]through,
cos every[Bm]day we pay the [E]price with a [Bm]little sacri[E]fice,
[G]Jammin till the jam is [F#m]through.


Were [Bm]jammin  [E7] - To think that [G]jammin was a thing of the [F#m]past;
Were [Bm]jammin [E7] $\quad$ And I [G]hope this jam is gonna [F#7]last


No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we wont bow;
Neither can be bought nor sold.
We all defend the right; jah - jah children must unite:
Your life is worth much more than gold.


Were jammin, And were jammin in the name of the lord;
Were jammin, Were jammin right straight from yah.


[Bm]Yeh! holy mount [E]zion;
[Bm]Holy mount [E]zion:
[Bm]Jah sitteth in mount zion
[Bm]And rules all creation.


Yeah, were - were jammin
were jammin, See, I wanna jam it wid you
Were jammin, Im jammed: I hope youre jammin, too


Jams about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied.
True love that now exist is the love I cant resist,
So jam by my side.


Were jammin
I wanna jam it with you.
Were jammin, were jammin, were jammin, were jammin,
Were jammin, were jammin, were jammin, were jammin;
Hope you like jammin, too.
