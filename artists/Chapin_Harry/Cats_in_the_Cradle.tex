M[A]y child arrived just the [C]other day;
he [D]came into the world in the [A]usual way.
But there were [A]planes to catch, and [C]bills to pay.
H[D]e learned to walk while I [A]was away.
And he was [G]talkin' 'fore I [G/F#]knew it.  And [Em7]as he gr[Em/D]ew
he'd say, ''[C]I'm gonna [Em/B]be like [A]you, Dad.  You [C]know I'm gonna [Em/B]be like [A]you.''



And the c[A]at's in the cradle and the s[G]ilver spoon,
[C]little boy blue and the [D]man in the moon.
[A]''When you comin' home Dad?''  ''I [G]don't know when,
but w[C]e'll get tog[Em/B]ether the[A]n, Son.  You [C]know we'll have a [Em/B]good time [A]then.''



My [A]son turned ten just the [C]other day.
He said, ''[D]Thanks for the ball, Dad.  Come [A]on, let's play.
Can you [A]teach me to throw?''  I said, ''[C]Not today.
I got a [D]lot to do.''  He said, ''T[A]hat's okay.''
And he [G]walked a[G/F#]way, but his s[Em7]mile never d[Em/D]immed.
It said, ''[C]I'm gonna b[Em/B]e like [A]him, yeah.  You [C]know I'm gonna [Em/B]be like [A]him.''



And the c[A]at's in the cradle and the s[G]ilver spoon,
[C]little boy blue and the [D]man in the moon.
[A]''When you comin' home Dad?''  ''I [G]don't know when,
but w[C]e'll get tog[Em/B]ether the[A]n, Son.  You [C]know we'll have a [Em/B]good time [A]then.''



Well, he [A]came home from college just the [C]other day,
so [D]much like a man I just [A]had to say,
''Son, I'm [A]proud of you.  Can you [C]sit for a while?''
He [D]shook his head and he [A]said with a smile,
''What I'd [G]really like, [G/F#]Dad, is to [Em7]borrow the car [Em/D]keys.
[C]See you [Em/B]later.  Can I [A]have them please?''



And the c[A]at's in the cradle and the s[G]ilver spoon,
[C]little boy blue and the [D]man in the moon.
[A]''When you comin' home Son?''  ''I [G]don't know when,
but w[C]e'll get tog[Em/B]ether the[A]n, Dad.  You [C]know we'll have a [Em/B]good time [A]then.''

I've [A]long since retired, my [C]son's moved away.
[D]I called him up just the [A]other day.
I said, ''I'd [A]like to see you if [C]you don't mind.''
He said, ''I'd [D]love to, Dad, if I could [A]find the time.
You see, my [G]new job's a [G/F#]hassle and the [Em7]kids have the f[Em/D]lu,
but it's [C]sure nice [Em/B]talkin' to [A]you, Dad.  It's been [C]sure nice [Em/B]talkin' to [A]you.''
And as I [G]hung up the [G/F#]phone it [Em7]occured to m[Em/D]e,
he'd [C]grown up [Em/B]just like [A]me.    My [C]boy was [Em/B]just like [A]me.



And the c[A]at's in the cradle and the s[G]ilver spoon,
[C]little boy blue and the [D]man in the moon.
[A]''When you comin' home Son?''  ''I [G]don't know when,
but [C]we'll get tog[Em/B]ether the[A]n, Dad, we're [C]gonna have a [Em/B]good time [A]then.''
