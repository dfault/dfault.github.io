\begin{guitar}
In the t[G]imbers of Fennario,
The w[Bb]olves are running r[F]ound,
The w[F]inter was so hard and cold,
Froze ten feet 'neath the gr[G]ound.
Don't murder [F]m[G]e,
I beg of y[C]ou, don't m[Bb]urder m[F]e.
Ple[G]as[F]e, don't murder m[C]e.



I s[G]at down to my supper,
'Tw[Bb]as a bottle of red whisk[F]y,
I s[F]aid my prayers and went to bed,
That's the l[C]ast they [C/B]saw [C/Bb]of    me\quad[a]{}



Don't murder me,
I beg of you, don't murder me.
Please, don't murder me.



Wh[Bb]en [Am]I awoke, the Dire W[G]olf,
Six h[C]undred p[Bb]ounds of s[F]in,
W[F]as grinning at my window,
All I said was ``Come on [G]in''.



Don't murder [F]m[G]e,
I beg of y[C]ou, don't m[E7]urder m[a]e.
Pl[G]eas[F]e, don't murder m[C]e.



The Wolf came in, I got my cards,
We sat down for a game.
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades,
But the cards were all the same.
Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me.
Please, don't murder me.



In the backwash of Fennario,
The black and bloody mire,
The Dire Wolf collects his due,
While the boys sing 'round the fire.



Don't murder me,
I beg of you, don't murder me.
Please, don't murder me.



No, no, no don't murder me.
I beg of you, Don't murder me.
Please, don't murder me.
