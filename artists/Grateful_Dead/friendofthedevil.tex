\begin{guitar}


[G]I lit out from reno, I was [C]trailed by twenty hounds
[G]Didnt get to sleep last night till the [C]morning came around.


[D]Set out runnin but I take my time
A [Am]friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If [D]I get home before daylight
I [Am]just might get some [C]sleep ton[D]ight.


Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in utah in a cave up in the hills.

Set out runnin but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.

Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight.


[D]Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
The [Am]first ones named sweet anne marie, and shes my hearts delight.
The [D]second one is prison, babe, the sheriffs on my trail,
And [Am]if he catches up with me, I'll [C]spend my life in [D]jail.


Got a wife in chino, babe, and one in cherokee
The first one says shes got my child, but it dont look like me.

Set out runnin but I take my time,
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight.
