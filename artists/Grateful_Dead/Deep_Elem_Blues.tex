Once I Had A Girlfriend, 
She Meant The World To Me 
She Went Down To Deep Elem, 
Now She Ain't What She Used To Be 
 


Once I Knew A Preacher, 
Preached The Bible Through And Through 
He went down to Deep Elem, 
Now His Preaching Days Are Through 
 


When You Go Down To Deep Elem 
To Have A Little Fun, 
Have Your Ten Dollars Ready 
When The Police Man Comes 
 


When you go down to Deep Elem 
Put your money in your pants 
Cause the women in Deep Elem 
They don't give a man a chance
