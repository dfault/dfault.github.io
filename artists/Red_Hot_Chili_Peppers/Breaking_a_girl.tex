I Am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged



[G]Feeling so [D]good that [Em]da[G]y
A feeling of [D]love that d[C]ay



[Em]Twisting and [D/F#]turning
Your f[G]eelings are b[Am]urning
You're [B]breaking the [B/A]girl[B/G]\qquad\qquad[B/F#]\qquad
[Em]She [D/F#]meant [G]you [Am]no h[C]arm
[Em]Think you're so c[D/F#]lever
But [G]now you must s[Am]ever
You're [B]breaking the [B/A]girl[B/G]\qquad\qquad[B/F#]\qquad
[Em]He l[D/F#]oves [G]no [am]one [C]els[C7]e



Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home



I don't know what when or why
The twilight of love had arrived



Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else
