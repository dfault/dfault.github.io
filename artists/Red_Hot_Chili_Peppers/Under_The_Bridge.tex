\begin{guitar}
[E]Sometimes [B]I feel like [C#m]I don't have a p[G#m]artne[A]r.
[E]Sometimes [B]I feel like [C#m]my only f[A]riend,
Is the [E]city I l[B]ive in, the city of angels
[C#m]The city of [G#m]angel[A]s
[E]Lonely as [B]I am [C#m]together we [A]cry[E7]   
 


[F#m]I don't ever want [E]to feel [B]like [F#m]I did that day.
Take me to the place [E]I love, [B]take [F#m]me all the way,



[A]Under the bridge [C]down-town
[G6]is where I [F7]drew some blood.
