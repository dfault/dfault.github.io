[E]Sometimes [B]I feel like [C#m]I don't have a p[G#m]artne[A]r.
[E]Sometimes [B]I feel like [C#m]my only f[A]riend,
Is the [E]city I l[B]ive in, the city of angels
[C#m]The city of [G#m]angel[A]s
[E]Lonely as [B]I am [C#m]together we [A]cry[E7]   
 


I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie.


Well, I d[F#m]on't ever want to f[E/B]eel l[B]ike I d[F#m]id that day
T[F#m]ake me to the place I l[E/B]ove, t[B]ake me a[F#m]ll the way
I d[F#m]on't ever want to f[E/B]eel l[B]ike I d[F#m]id that day
T[F#m]ake me to the place I l[E/B]ove, t[B]ake me a[F#m]ll the w[E/B]ay, ye[B]ah, y[Dbm]eah, y[Abm]eah
\chords{A|E/B|B|Dbm|A}



It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe and I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry


Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah



o[A]h n[Am]o, no, no, y[G]eah, y[F]eah
l[A]ove m[Am]e, i say, y[G]eah y[F]eah



u[A]nder the bridge downt[Am]own
...i[G]s where I d[F]rew some blood
under the bridge downtown
...I could not get enough
under the bridge downtown
...forgot about my love
under the bridge downtown
...I gave my life away



way, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Oh no, i say, yeah yeah
              yeah yeah
