[G]Hey, where did [C]we go
[G]Days when the [D]rains came?
[G]Down in the [C]hollow
[G]Playin' a [D]new game

Laughin' and a-runnin', hey hey
Skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog
With our, our hearts a-thumpin'

And [C]you, [D]my brown eyed [G]girl [e] $\quad$
[C]You my [D]brown eyed [G]girl [D] $\quad$

And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio

Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
Slippin' and a-slidin'
All along the waterfall

With you, my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing?
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
Just like that
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
La te da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown

Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
Makin' love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when
We used to sing?
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
(Lyin' in the green grass!)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
(Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
(Sha la la la la, la la la la, la te da, la te da, la te da, da da da)
Sha la la, la la, la la, la la, l-la te da
