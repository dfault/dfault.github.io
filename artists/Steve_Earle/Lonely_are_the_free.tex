\begin{guitar}
(Capo 4th fret)

[A]Lonely are the free, there ain't that many of them
They don't [f#]walk like you and me

They just [A]tumble in the breeze, lighter than a feather
All to[f#]gether, separately

That's [D]how it's s'posed to be, no matter where they wander
From [f#]post to in between, from here to over yonder
There's no [A]place for them to land
[f#]Lonely are the free

The silent are the strong, not so much as a whisper
Tells you anything is wrong

You've known all along, but you can't help but listen
And now the moment's gone

It keeps you hanging on, until the stillness signaling
The breaking of the dawn, is shattered by the sirens
Singing sacrificial songs
The silent are the strong

That's all they used to see, a violent shadow passing 'cross
The sun so fleetingly, that if you have to ask you miss it
Anyway you see
Lonely are the free
Lonely are the free
