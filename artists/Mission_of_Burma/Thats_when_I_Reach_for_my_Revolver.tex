\begin{guitar}
O[E]nce I had my heroes
Once I had my dreams
But all of that is changed now
G[A]ots twisted inside out
T[C]he truth is not that comfortable, no



Mother taught us patience
The virtues of restraint
Father taught us boundaries
The knowledge we must go
I'm trying to protect my unity



Th[B]at's wh[A]en I r[C#m]each for my r[D#]evolver
That's when it all gets blown away
That's when I reach for my revolver
That feeling passes by this way



A friend of mine once told me
His one and only aim
To build a giant castle
And in it sign his name
The silence wraps us in its chains



That's when I reach for my revolver
That's when it all gets blown away
That's when I reach for my revolver
That feeling passes by this way



And now the sky is empty
But that is nothing new
The dead eyes look upon us
And they tell me 
we're nothing 



but then
That's when I reach for my revolver
That's when I reach for my revolver
That's when I reach for my revolver
That's when I reach for my revolver
That's when I reach for my revolver
That's when I reach for my revolver
