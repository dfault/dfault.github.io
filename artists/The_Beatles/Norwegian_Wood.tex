[D]I once had a girl, or should I say
sh[C]e once had m[D]e.
Sh[D]e showed me her room, isn't it good?
N[C]orwegian w[D]ood.



She [Dm]asked my to stay and told me to sit [G]anywhere,
So [Dm]I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a [Em]cha[A/A7]ir.



[D]I sat on a rug, biding my time,
dr[C]inking her w[D]ine.
W[D]e talked until two, and then she said,
[C]It's time for b[D]ed.


She t[Dm]old me she worked in the morning and started to l[G]augh,
[Dm]I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the [em]ba[A/A7]th.



[D]And when I awoke, I was alone, th[C]is bird has fl[D]own.
So [D]I lit a fire, isn't it good?
N[C]orwegian w[D]ood.\qquad{}[C]{}[D]{}[C]{}[Dm7]{}[D]
