\begin{guitar}
capo 3rd fret

\chords{C|Em|Dm|Am|G} (3x)



[C]My timing is o[Em]ff
S[Dm]he isn't r[Am]eady for my l[G]ove
I[C]t's all that I g[Em]ot
B[Dm]ut it's a pre[Am]tty big t[G]hing



T[F]hat she should r[C]ecognize;
The t[Am]ruth between us cannot h[Em]ide\qquad[G]{}



She knows that it's real
But the situation doesn't fit
I know what I feel
And I know that this is really



Everything it's all about
And I don't have a single doubt



My timing is off
But sometimes that's how it all works
Believe it or not
We don't have a choice



In matters of the heart;
Just gotta be brave enough
To love and let yourself be loved



My timing is off
And I'm not worried 'bout a thing
She knows that it's real
She couldn't throw it all away



For fear of happiness
This isn't like that other mess
