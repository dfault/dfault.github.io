\begin{guitar}
[E]I can't watch the r[D]ocketl[A]aunch
[E]The trophy wives of the [D]astron[A]aughts
[E]and I can't listen to th[D]eir w[A]ords
c[E]ause I like... birds



I don't care for walking downtown
crazy autocar gonna mow me down
and look at all those people like cows in a herd
but I like... birds



If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on



I can't stand the line at the store
you mean little people are such a bore
but its alright if you act like a turd
cause I like... birds



If you're small and on a search 
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
\end{guitar}
