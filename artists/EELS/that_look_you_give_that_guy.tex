[C]I never th[C/B]ought that I could b[Bb]e so bold\qquad[A]{}
[Dm]To even s[Dm/C]ay these thoughts a[G7/B]loud\qquad[G7]{}
[C]I see you w[C/B]ith your man, your e[Bb]yes just shine\qquad[A]{}
[Dm]While he stands t[Dm/C]all and walking p[G7/B]roud\qquad[G7]{}



That look you give that guy I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd never let you down



It always seems like you're going somewhere
Better than you've been before
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
Of you knocking at my door



That look you give that guy I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd be all I can be, I'd be all I can be



I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
I'm nothing much I know it's true
I lack the style and the pedigree
And my chances are so few



That look you give that guy I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd give you all I got



I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
But if, let's say, it won't work out
You know where I can be found



That look you give that guy I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd never let you down, I'd never let you down
