[G]sometimes it's [C]hard to be [G]there

[G]and through the [D]all seeing [G]eye
[G]and through the [D]all seeing [G]eye

there was a man, he sang so pretty
he loved me for two thousand years
why'd he come to new york city
once upon a time in america
once upon a time in america

\\
he [am]said: ``y[C]ou'll all get [D]back [G]again,
some[am]tim[C]es it's [D]hard to [G]see
we bel[am]ong to [C]all [D]God's [G]countries''

[C]once [G]upon a time [D]in ameri[G]ca
[C]once [G]upon a time [D]in ameri[G]ca

they found a piece of paradise
and built a city there
they didn't want to see the future
once upon a time in america
once upon a time in america

\\
he said: ``you'll all get back again,
this is the land of the free,
we belong to all God's countries''

once upon a time in america
once upon a time in america

\\
he said: ``you'll all get back again,
this is the land of the freak!
we belong to all God's countries''

once upon a time in america
