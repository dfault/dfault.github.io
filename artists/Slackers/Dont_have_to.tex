\begin{guitar}
I spent thr[F]ee years learning how to talk
The next th[Bb]irty learning n[F]ot to
Tw[F]o years learning how to walk
About the s[G7]ame for a motorc[C7]ycle
E[F]ight years living in a powder keg
But only a m[Bb]oment to light a m[F]atch
But then [F]I found you and you f[D7]ound me too
And n[Bb]ow I j[C7]ust don't h[F]ave to


I walked five miles up a hill through a foot of snow
To make a phone call home on your birthday
I swam eight miles fighting off a hammerhead shark
To get your present there by Thursday
Climb a thousand foot hill using only one hand
Just to tell the world of my convictions
But you already knew that our love grew
And now I just don't have to



I spent no time taking you for granted
And I guess that I never will now
A lot of time thinking about your love
A'cause it's giving me such a thrill now
Sunday morning I'm thanking the Lord for you
With a quick nod to the devil
I was so blue, just fighting for you
And now I just don't have to



Uh[Bb]uh, I j[C7]ust don't h[F]ave to
I said n[Bb]ow I j[C7]ust don't h[F]ave to
[Bb]I j[C7]ust don't... H[F]ave to
